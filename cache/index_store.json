Introduction\n\nDispensers for Safe Water (DSW) is a program implemented by Evidence Action in rural remote regions of Kenya, Uganda and Malawi. DSW installs chlorine dispensers next to commonly used water sources, enabling people to treat their water using a safe and pre-measured dose of chlorine. The chlorine stays active for 2-3 days, ensuring water doesn’t get re-contaminated even when stored at home. Before installing a dispenser, DSW engages with communities to secure their buy-in. The communities appoint their own “dispenser promoter” who is a trusted individual who trains and encourages locals to use the dispenser, he/she also refills the dispenser and communicates to the program when the dispenser repairs are needed. The program has installed over 52,984 dispensers; 18,804 in Kenya, 16,233 in Malawi and 17,947 in Uganda. The dispenser numbers in Uganda and Malawi significantly increased following the 2022-2023 program expansion that resulted in the installation of an additional 12,000 dispensers in each of the two countries.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"elB6wDbSpaUimHHfkVIdxCx/s9OKaygepN53/4A2woM="},"bf4932c7-04b9-4d55-9a13-cf7492ffa253":{"id_":"bf4932c7-04b9-4d55-9a13-cf7492ffa253","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"TWQvJK4EHY+U3wUFi3xxn3XF5gkDlp6+aHBikYkSHSs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d94c468d-c78f-44bd-b314-1daa3e308bee","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"elB6wDbSpaUimHHfkVIdxCx/s9OKaygepN53/4A2woM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"af96b2c7-e624-4c66-a68a-612ea6d2b609","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"r42cgLdvrLn+CCP2miPX+XFDKUix4Cv/TwZ6xE19AIA="}},"text":"Adoption monitoring (AM) of the Safe Water Now programs is a crucial aspect of the program’s MLE plan. AM is the routine performance monitoring of the SWN programs and collects key performance indicators (KPIs) such as chlorine adoption and device functionality rates from a representative sample of the devices throughout the year. Functionality indicators confirm that the outputs reported are reliable and adoption indicators serve to measure program performance toward desired outcomes (and serve as inputs into the cost-effectiveness (CE) models that provide estimates of program impact). AM sample sizes, tools, and frequency for DSW are crucial aspects of the AM design and dictate the level at which results can be reported as well as frequency of program feedback. Effective January 2023, the timelines for adoption monitoring were adjusted from bi-monthly to quarterly. Refer annex 2 the adoption monitoring design note for more details on the rationale for the AM redesign. This document will act as a guide and will contain a set of best practices for the Field Operations Team regarding the procedures and processes to be followed when conducting adoption monitoring for both DSW program. # 2. Teams and Roles\n\nMLE Strategy Safe Water lead: Guides on the MLE-SWN scope of work in addition to providing budget, strategic and technical oversight of monitoring and evaluation activities. Develop and update monitoring frameworks, key performance indicators, survey questionnaires and identify right fit monitoring, research and evaluation methodology and sampling approaches. Associate director MLE Delivery: Works closely with the MLE strategy and Delivery teams to provide budget, strategic and technical oversight of monitoring and evaluation activities. Manager Field Operations, MLE: Recruits, trains, organizes, and oversees data collection teams, develops systems and M&E best practices for field teams and ensures adherence to budget availability. Analysis team: Support in water point randomization, conduct timely and insightful analysis to track program KPIs and support program improvements. The team is responsible for analysing back-check data, conducting deeper analysis on the existing monitoring data to generate any trends on key performance indicators. Quality assurance and quality control team: Support in development and implementation of systems and protocols for quality data and analysis including frequent data checks on consistent implementation as well lead in survey testing. The team keeps constant communication with different teams to ensure any data quality concern is escalated as soon as it arises. The team also works closely with the analysis team to ensure that timelines for bi-weekly rapid analysis and back checks are adhered to.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XBq8vs1MDFpG1ijWmYTsJgV5pPB7m0pnY2bafrHCwRM="},"af96b2c7-e624-4c66-a68a-612ea6d2b609":{"id_":"af96b2c7-e624-4c66-a68a-612ea6d2b609","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"TWQvJK4EHY+U3wUFi3xxn3XF5gkDlp6+aHBikYkSHSs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bf4932c7-04b9-4d55-9a13-cf7492ffa253","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"XBq8vs1MDFpG1ijWmYTsJgV5pPB7m0pnY2bafrHCwRM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8644a0f2-f7fc-4146-992b-4dac5d8278f6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"tJSp2nFZYcmoOApE9rN0wgV24anRHxSSVSIhLQQflmg="}},"text":"Programming and Data Management (PDM): The team is responsible for the programming of all the paper surveys and making any edits on electronic surveys as needed.

The Associates are the direct supervisors of the MLE Officers. # 2. Roles and Responsibilities\n\nOfficers, Field Operations, MLE: They collect quality data from randomized households, submit it for cleaning and analysis, and later disseminate the results to the program teams. They also supervise short term staff posted in their designated offices in addition to managing any hard copy means of verification documents. Short term staff (Casuals): They support in collecting monitoring and evaluation data in offices with higher number of water points, support with M&E work when M&E FOs have been assigned other duties or when away on leave. Data Learning team: Facilitate internal MLE dissemination of results, develop digestible dashboards, donor reports and internal MLE reports and present MLE reports to programs. Refer to annex 2: organogram MLE delivery organogram for more information on MLE teams and responsibilities. # 3. Sampling Methodology\n\nSamples of DSW water points will be selected at the County/District level using Cochrane’s Formula for Sample Sizes, with results reported at a 90% CL and 5% MoE annually, equalling roughly a 80-85% CL and 10% MoE per quarterly monitoring period. # 4. Randomization Process\n\n# 4.1 Generation of Randomised Waterpoints List\n\nEvery quarter, the analysis team shares the randomised list of water points for the three countries in MS Excel with the manager field operations team. The FO manager scrutinizes the randomised list before sharing with the FOT Senior associates and associates for further scrutiny before sharing with the respective field officers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"r42cgLdvrLn+CCP2miPX+XFDKUix4Cv/TwZ6xE19AIA="},"8644a0f2-f7fc-4146-992b-4dac5d8278f6":{"id_":"8644a0f2-f7fc-4146-992b-4dac5d8278f6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"TWQvJK4EHY+U3wUFi3xxn3XF5gkDlp6+aHBikYkSHSs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"af96b2c7-e624-4c66-a68a-612ea6d2b609","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"r42cgLdvrLn+CCP2miPX+XFDKUix4Cv/TwZ6xE19AIA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1ca18562-8a3c-4c90-8c57-bae17c5c8609","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"AkB0MXx+uYzB+iIMNKSxLnjKHvPIE4yvy7j6MPAOwY4="}},"text":"The lists are then saved on a box file under the planning, tracking and logistics folder. # 4.2 Generation of Random Order Numbers\n\nOnce every year, the analysis team generates and shares the random order numbers and shares as an Excel workbook with the Manager FOT.

In cases where the promoter or the assistant is not available, the person who stays close to the water point or any other water point user who can give the required information is used. To avoid the bias that might arise from the promoter/person who lives closer to the water point by creating a systematically ordered arrangement of households (i.e. their friends and relatives being listed first), an in-field randomization will be conducted to ensure that a random sample of houses is surveyed. # An infield randomization follows the following steps:\n\n- First a random order is generated in excel that can accommodate either 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, up to 100 households. The need for multiple lists comes from the fact that in a water point with only 9 households, it would be difficult to follow a randomly ordered set of 100 numbers. Make sure that you have a blank copy of the infield randomization form for each water point visited. - Fill the first section of the form with water point details. - Ask the promoter/person that lives closer to the water point the number of households that use the water source. - After getting the overall number of users from the respondent, request them to give you the names of the household heads as you list in column two of the random order form. With the number of users listed, determine which random order list to use to select the households to survey. For example, for water points with 9, 17, 42, and 68 users, use the random orders on the columns with 10hh, 20hh, 50 and 70 hh respectively.

Lack of consent from the land-owner or the community for us to survey a water point and the affiliated households, even though the water point and/or dispenser is present and functional. 2. Program exit from a community – i.e. when the program decides to pull out or uninstall dispensers from a community that was initially within program coverage. 3. Community exit from the program – i.e. when the community explicitly or implicitly, temporarily, or permanently decides to withdraw from the program. 4. Water points un-functionality – i.e. if the water point itself (not the dispenser) breaks down or it becomes inaccessible for any other reason – e.g. flooding etc—but the dispenser remains functional and in its place.

In case M&E FOs use shared computers to download and print the list, they delete the folder including the copy on the recycle bin after they are done. Randomised lists are only saved on shared computers if the document is protected with a password. The associate supports the M&E FOs in ensuring that the system they use to get the lists is safe including guiding them on how to protect documents with passwords. Associates also check to confirm FOs are following the correct guidelines regarding the safety of randomised lists during their visits to field offices. If the randomised list is accidentally accessed by the program implementation team, a new randomised list is provided immediately. The M&E FO notifies the associate about this occurrence, the associate then notifies the manager field operations team who in turn notifies the manager analysis to randomise and share a new list immediately. Water points that have been visited before the occurrence are retained. Any water point visited after the list is accessed is disqualified and replaced. # 5. Adoption Monitoring Surveys\n\nThree surveys are administered during adoption monitoring. Each of these surveys have guidelines and frequently asked questions that provide extra information/emphasis on key areas and questions in the survey. The guidelines serve as a critical tool for training and onboarding new staff. Refer to annex 3 for the guidelines. Information from these surveys is what informs the key performance indicators for DSW. The surveys are:\n\n# 5.1 Spot Check Survey\n\nThis survey is administered by the field officer through observation and recording of findings from the water point. The survey is expected to take an average of 10 minutes. It checks:\n\n1. Water point functionality\n2. Water flow rate and appearance\n3. Dispenser functionality\n4. Dispenser information i.e. bar code\n5. Dispenser placement\n6. Presence of liquid chlorine\n\n# 5.2 Promoter Survey\n\nThis survey is administered to one promoter per water point. It can be administered to either the main promoter or assistant promoter (whoever is available between the two). The survey is expected to take an average of 30 minutes. The survey checks whether:\n\n1. The promoter conducts promotional activities\n2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Td+0fWSXN6TUFj10rOqExO8nWjJl0St+nUZeKPqfJF8="},"fd8d5f6b-2bcf-46b7-aa51-d642849937ec":{"id_":"fd8d5f6b-2bcf-46b7-aa51-d642849937ec","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"TWQvJK4EHY+U3wUFi3xxn3XF5gkDlp6+aHBikYkSHSs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b6e33ad8-e37f-49ed-85c8-294be1cf37b9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"Td+0fWSXN6TUFj10rOqExO8nWjJl0St+nUZeKPqfJF8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a947b89a-50b2-41ff-b348-8f7e8723fcce","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"kNFYfQXO/w7ZP1bx1kOuCcXIrtE2CcY61g0PmlgvllM="}},"text":"The survey checks whether:\n\n1.

Training and Refresher Training\n\nTraining of data collection staff is strongly linked to good data quality collection and processing, which is a key outcome of the MLE team.

Data collection staff by MLE team members\n2. Program staff who collect data as part of operation activities. Training of field staff will likely happen in 5 situations:\n\n1. New Hires: Training will be done to all new hires at the time of onboarding. The new staff will be trained on all instruments that s/he will be using, as well informed about the program goals and objectives. 2. New Data Collection Instrument: Whenever there is a new data collection instrument, a training is done to all the staff who are using the new data collection instrument. 3. Revision of Data Collection Instrument: Whenever there is a revision of an existing data collection instrument, the staff using it are trained on the revision. 4. Refresher Training: Whenever staff re-start a data collection activity after a break of more than 3 weeks, the staff are re-trained on the data collection instrument and processes. 5. Deployment to a different office/working area: Whenever staff are deployed to a different working area/office to go support data collection activities there, the staff trained on the differences in the data collection instrument process that they expect at the new working area/office. Staff training will be categorised into four main categories namely;\n\n1. New staff training content or Comprehensive Training Package; this training is the most comprehensive and geared towards new staff, but any other staff can also benefit. This is typically a 4-day training. 2. New instrument training content or Premium Training Package; this training is the second most comprehensive and geared towards staff interacting with a data collection instrument for the first time. The expectation is that only one or a few new instruments will be introduced at a time. The training is expected to take a shorter time compared to the comprehensive training package. 3.

Program field managers, associates and Program leads identify areas that need emphasis and re-training. This package is therefore flexible in terms of duration and content and both are decided on depending on the need and budgetary consideration. Refer to annex 7: Data collection training protocol for more information on training of data collectors. # 8. Staff Management and Reporting Structure\n\n# 8.1 Management of M&E FOs\n\nThe Safe Water Program is spread across multiple countries: Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi. The spread of activities across diverse geographic locations has necessitated the adoption of structures by MLE to ensure that we can be geographically close to the specific areas of operations, while at the same time operating within reasonable budgetary constraints. MLE, which works closely with the programs, and in most cases shares their infrastructure, has adopted a matrix system of field staff management that will allow for synchronised and coordinated management of our M&E FOs with the support and involvement of the program staff. In this matrix system, Administrative Supervisor (dotted line) and Technical Supervisor (solid line) will both serve a vital role in the daily supervision of M&E field staff. The coordinators and/or associate coordinators will serve as the administrative supervisors for M&E FOs while MLE field operations team associates will serve as their technical supervisors. In cases where the senior associate or associate’s duty station is in a different location from their supervisor’s, the program lead in the respective office will act as the technical supervisor for the senior associate or associate. For more information on this structure, refer to annex 8: MLE management and reporting structure for M&E FOs. # 8.2 Management of Short -Term Monitors\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of field activities, short term monitors will be called upon to support in conducting the quarterly evaluations.

Quality control and Quality Assurance Checks\n\n# 10.1 Targeted Back Checks\n\nTo ensure that the set standards are met and data collected is accurate, MLE will from time to time conduct back checks to selected water points based on the result of the evaluations. Targeted back checks will be conducted to selected water points that have a significant discrepancy between TRC and FCR readings and/or significant drop or increase in adoption numbers. These back checks will only be conducted if collected data cannot explain the reason for the discrepancy. Respective field operations team associates will conduct these checks on randomised water points shared by the analysis team. Households that were visited under the randomised water points and one promoter per randomised water point are interviewed. The goals of back checks are to;\n\n- a. Assess the effectiveness of the survey instrument\n- b. Detect fraud in the data collection process\n- c. Verify adherence to set data collection protocol/standards e.g. use of infield randomization protocol\n- d. Identify source of any irregularities in the data\n- e. Identify areas where further emphasis should be put during training or where retraining of data collection staff is needed\n- f. Performance evaluation-This will be used to fairly and objectively evaluate the performance of field teams based on accuracy of data collected that will initiate discussions about areas that are well done and those poorly done. Refer to annex 10 for Back checks protocol, Annex 11 community back check survey and annex 12 promoter back check survey\n\n# 10.2 Random Back Checks\n\nRandom backchecks will occur in six batches per quarter with each batch covering two weeks of the MP.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mEs8CHw/lpRG/7eZXP1zoPODxGYGrzbCfwV3yIBHO3U="},"9c3b0d39-11e1-4ef8-ad40-861d8e502bfc":{"id_":"9c3b0d39-11e1-4ef8-ad40-861d8e502bfc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"TWQvJK4EHY+U3wUFi3xxn3XF5gkDlp6+aHBikYkSHSs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c7ec1ce1-49f4-4f05-8270-afbb44d15c18","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"mEs8CHw/lpRG/7eZXP1zoPODxGYGrzbCfwV3yIBHO3U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"05f12c3f-e4c7-49a0-a234-891d42b87828","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"n0qbkC84DCvYCqodRZwToopRqEQN0puwxRLOXf8LYs0="}},"text":"WPs included in each batch will be mutually exclusive; a WP in one batch will not be included in any of the five other batches in the MP.

Program Team and M&E FO Interactions\n\nM&E field officers play a major role of collecting adoption monitoring data which is later cleaned, analysed, and shared with program teams to enable them make informed decisions that would enhance program performance. To achieve this, the interaction between M&E FOs and program staff is key. Below are some of the key areas that should guide this interaction regarding adoption monitoring. 1. Sharing of feedback. M&E FOs will share feedback with office leads regarding dispenser issues on the ground for immediate corrective action. This should be done daily after they come back from the field. Any further discussions on adoption should be organized between the program team and MLE leads based on need. 2. Participation in debrief meetings. 16 | Page\n---\n# Last Edited 19th June 2024 by Faridah Mung’oni\n\n# 1. M&E FOs Participation\n\nM&E FOs will attend and participate in the brief meetings organized by the program office leads. This is a good platform for the FOs to share their feedback, findings, and learnings from the field. The program team will use this feedback to plan on the way forward. # 2. Not Sharing Sample Results from the Field\n\nM&E FOs are discouraged from sharing samples from the field since experiences from the past have indicated misuse of these figures to calculate ‘expected’ adoption figures. This is because adoption figures are weighted and may result in misunderstanding and/or mistrust between teams in case different figures are reported. Officers are also discouraged from sharing the list of sampled water points with the program teams after visiting the water points. Any requests to share such lists should be forwarded to the field operations associates for further discussion with the relevant program teams. # 3. Sharing of Activity Plans & Budget\n\nEvery three months (on the 25th of the third month), field operations team associates share work plan and budget with program team leads. These plans & budgets help the program team to be aware of the monitoring activities that will be happening in respective offices during a particular period. For offices where M&E FOs have both administrative and technical supervisors, the plan & budget helps the administrative supervisor to plan well in terms of logistical and financial support they are supposed to offer to the respective FOs. At the end of every three months, the associates prepare an actual expenditure report.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LU7B7Ab+yf5kitTrrptjS5O1i5M6BeCKnq3bxSDgkCQ="},"3a2beb47-eb16-4912-9e5f-e8f20dcb7e0e":{"id_":"3a2beb47-eb16-4912-9e5f-e8f20dcb7e0e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"TWQvJK4EHY+U3wUFi3xxn3XF5gkDlp6+aHBikYkSHSs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ad9b729a-40eb-4382-b3b2-49d8792e879b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"LU7B7Ab+yf5kitTrrptjS5O1i5M6BeCKnq3bxSDgkCQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"eb1a62df-61b9-4161-a70f-d834964797c5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf","file_name":"Adoption monitoring protocol_DSW_19062024.pdf"},"hash":"DBRIBdilcEHr57QRK9tycgeiYPSlavZVTQmenImtRAM="}},"text":"At the end of every three months, the associates prepare an actual expenditure report.

Adoption Dissemination Meetings\n\nAt the end of every quarter, MLE FOs and associates disseminate adoption monitoring results to the field teams at the office level. The dissemination meetings started in 2021 with the following key objectives:\n\n1. Build the capacity of FOs. This intervention enables FOs to directly deal with the outputs from the MLE’s analysis and learning departments for the adoption drivers’ report. 2. Scale MLE presence and visibility within the SWN program. Increasing MLE’s footprint, particularly at the program’s decision-making stage enhances MLE’s relevance among programs. 3. Enhance the working relationship between the MLE and the SWN Program through constant interaction. 4. Continuously improve the quality of data collected by the MLE FOs. 5. Promote constant and timely sharing of reports. The DL team shares the analysis output with the MLE FOs who translate it to digestible PowerPoint presentations. The DL team reviews the final PPTs before sharing them with the FOs for dissemination. The Field Operation associates schedule the dissemination meetings with the program teams at office level. These dissemination meetings should happen during and not later than the second week of the month after the completion of the adoption monitoring data collection. Field operation associates document key recommendations and action points from these meetings on the adoption monitoring dissemination meeting’s notes document. Other MLE sub-team representatives join the dissemination meetings virtually to respond to data questions from the teams. # 5.

Policies are reviewed and approved by the Executive Vice President, Africa and are adopted to guide decision-making. # Procedure\n\nA procedure is a set of instructions that outline the established or official way of carrying out a specific task in a certain order or manner. # Guidelines\n\nA guideline aims to streamline particular processes by offering recommendations on how to carry out a particular routine or task. Unlike policy, guidelines are not mandatory. # Benefits\n\nA form of non-monetary compensation that team members receive in addition to a regular salary. For detailed policy guidelines and procedures, employees should always refer to the Global P&C Policy Manual, available on the intranet or their country-specific NRS Supplement. Information in the Global P&C Policy and NRS Supplements supersedes the information in this guide and will be referenced in cases of clarification or dispute. ---\n# AFRICA REGION | Employee Handbook\n\n# ABOUT EVIDENCE ACTION\n\n# Our Mission\n\nEvidence Action aims to be a world leader in scaling evidence-based and cost-effective programs to reduce the burden of poverty – defines how we contribute to that vision. # Our Vision\n\nBuilding a world where hundreds of millions of poor people have better opportunities and their lives are measurably improved – articulates the state of the world we want to see. # Our Values\n\n- Evidence first. We are led by facts. We go where the data takes us. Robust, rigorous evidence informs our choices and decisions. - Think big, act urgently. We are unrelenting in our pursuit of results at scale. We know that poverty does not wait. We act so that the best ideas deliver benefits to millions. - Iterate, again. We reflect constantly and adapt accordingly. We test, measure, and improve to ensure impact.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lFJV35aoDSALpZ9Hy40/R2agH6cUP+0V6iDIpYn2t00="},"4f13ad53-be8d-4f76-8890-0e38f5ffba9d":{"id_":"4f13ad53-be8d-4f76-8890-0e38f5ffba9d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"hash":"ksNfvKJK2vOLteqY9+aWRUnhqArpWaEjKowXgZqiQMA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"539d0f5b-a31b-4cca-92d2-b6c29b7956ea","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"hash":"lFJV35aoDSALpZ9Hy40/R2agH6cUP+0V6iDIpYn2t00="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e20f1f8d-3e4a-4f1a-8ea7-83a9c63244d1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"hash":"WAy/C6jVh3zqdZwRGZtt43+tIs+RtqRfn/2GUGbrNms="}},"text":"We reflect constantly and adapt accordingly. We test, measure, and improve to ensure impact. If we can do something, we can do it better. - Economize without compromise. The biggest impact at the lowest cost is what we are after. We ensure value for money for all our stakeholders but know there is no substitute for quality. - Challenge convention. We ask “why” and “why not” in equal measure. We are sincere in our skepticism and incessant in our search for solutions. - Passion throughout. We are driven to lessen inequality, to improve lives. We take action, converting impatience into impact. # What we do\n\nOur approach fills the gap between research about what works and solutions for people in need. We operate in more than five countries across the globe and positively impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people every year in a measurable way. Below we highlight the programs that we are involved in. # 1. Safe Water Now\n---\n# AFRICA REGION | Employee Handbook\n\nAn estimated 525,000 children under five die from diarrhea each year, often due to unsafe water. Our chlorine dispensers are installed directly next to untreated water sources, allowing residents to add a precise dose of diluted chlorine to their jerrican before filling it with water. At a cost of less than $1.50 per person per year, Dispensers for Safe Water is an innovative and cost-effective approach to the challenge of unsafe water in poor, rural areas. Our in-line chlorination program was incubated in Evidence Action’s Accelerator and builds on our highly successful Dispensers for Safe Water program. By automatically treating communal piped water systems, this innovation has the potential to dramatically expand the number of people we can reach with lifesaving access to safe drinking water. # 2. Deworm the World\n\nMore than 835 million preschool- and school-age children are at risk of parasitic worm infection. The Deworm the World Initiative partners with governments to develop and implement national, school-based deworming programs. We have supported the delivery of over 1.3 billion deworming treatments since 2014 at an average cost of less than USD $0.50 per treatment, with measurable improvements in health, economic, and educational outcomes. # 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ojY+v7PCSCEX9ngPByAdryTe7Ts4UTDFKk4KmurnQlo="},"e20f1f8d-3e4a-4f1a-8ea7-83a9c63244d1":{"id_":"e20f1f8d-3e4a-4f1a-8ea7-83a9c63244d1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"hash":"ksNfvKJK2vOLteqY9+aWRUnhqArpWaEjKowXgZqiQMA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4f13ad53-be8d-4f76-8890-0e38f5ffba9d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"hash":"ojY+v7PCSCEX9ngPByAdryTe7Ts4UTDFKk4KmurnQlo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f8ac6486-9801-404f-a77f-25898ace0002","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf","file_name":"Africa Employee Handbook_08 April 24.pdf"},"hash":"RFQ75atD2aQaj99gSlBh8WBQYAHgoBR2kwq9d05awTE="}},"text":"# 3. Equal Vitamin Access\n\nAn estimated 600 million children around the world suffer from anemia, a condition that impairs physical and cognitive development and weakens the immune system. Rigorous evidence shows regular iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation significantly reduces the risk of this condition. Beginning in India, we’re testing how this intervention can be delivered cost-effectively to millions of children through schools. # 4. Syphilis-Free Start\n\nApproximately one million pregnant women around the world are infected with active syphilis. By preventing mother-to-child transmission of syphilis, we can avert thousands of cases of neonatal mortality and disability every year. We are seeking to change this paradigm by working with governments to adopt and scale rapid HIV/syphilis dual testing in prenatal care settings, dramatically increasing countries’ ability to detect and treat the disease before it causes complications to the child. ---\n# AFRICA REGION | Employee Handbook\n\n# Africa Regional Leadership\n\nThe Africa Region is led by the Executive Vice President and is divided into two sub-hubs; East & Southern Africa (ESA) and West & Central Africa (WCA).

INTRODUCTION\n\nEvidence Action is a learning organization committed to constant improvement, creativity and agility. Some of our core values are to ‘iterate again and ‘challenge convention’ to ensure sustainability in an increasingly complex and changing operating environment. Evidence Action supports staff development because of its benefits to our staff, as individuals, and to the organization in achieving its objectives. For the individual employee, Evidence Action's investment in professional development helps to foster employee engagement and satisfaction and helps the employee to grow and contribute better. For the organization, investing in professional development helps to ensure that we have the skills needed to reach our strategic goals, and prepares staff to step into new roles. The overarching goal of learning in Evidence Action is to optimize organizational performance to ensure quality services for our beneficiaries whilst also providing a means for individuals to develop skills and expertise for career advancement in Evidence Action. Learning in Evidence Action needs to be aligned with the organization's strategic goals/priorities and in an environment of cost consciousness, to effectively balance the strategic, long-term needs of the organization with the career aspirations of individual staff. However, it is in the interest of Evidence Action to ensure that all Evidence Action employees receive proper and relevant learning to perform their designated duties efficiently and with a minimum of difficulties. This policy outlines the learning principles to ensure a fair, transparent and cost-effective approach to the provision of learning opportunities for employees in the African region. # 2. LEARNING PRINCIPLES\n\nEvidence Action’s learning principles are guided by the Global Learning and Development Philosophy.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fUVk/QXYEEiAkfQaZW4zpL4DD8EOSQWOeA9XtxC7yh0="},"6b3de022-37f9-4cac-b453-a6e4ec824c35":{"id_":"6b3de022-37f9-4cac-b453-a6e4ec824c35","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Na0nYubjmR3SaYaA2UmLS/9IBTwwIAMFfi33MzTrge4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4c81eaad-d1c4-458a-9816-06458923db1f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"fUVk/QXYEEiAkfQaZW4zpL4DD8EOSQWOeA9XtxC7yh0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f9c60b0a-2842-4bf3-938a-0982c2da6ce2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"WRMqvU1ctso+FetVNnRKedw/LJoWgepcfkBIS9e3P6s="}},"text":"The leadership is committed to fostering a culture by which we make decisions about Learning and Development by emphasizing the following principles:\n\n# Prioritize Learning through Experience\n\nWe believe that learning isn’t a single event, it’s continuous. And some of the most impactful learning happens when working and interacting with others in the workplace. Structured learning is important, but it is not the primary way in which people achieve high levels of performance. We prioritize learning through on-the-job experiences and focus on skills that will positively impact our organizational priorities. # Emphasis on High-Leverage Skills\n---\n# AFRICA REGION\n\n# LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\nWe understand there is a volume of skills someone could learn in their career journey. We focus on “high-leverage skills,” the skills that are both critical to an individual’s success for their role at Evidence Action and syncs with their individual development objectives. We prioritize learning that aligns with our competencies of Rally Together, Find Solutions, and Embrace Improvement and take into account learning interventions that allow for immediate application and impact in a given role. # Evaluate Needs and Determine ROI\n\nWhen investing in learning and development initiatives, we conduct training needs assessments to identify the learning areas that are most needed and which will help us make the most progress on achieving our organizational objectives. We are purposeful with our investment and adhere to “economize without compromise” in our evaluation of the value of the initiative. We prioritize choices that allow us to remain cost-effective, sustainable, and maximize our impact. # Assess the Impact\n\nLearning should be personally energizing and serve a team-wide purpose. We use surveys and gather feedback to assess the effectiveness, applicability, and impact of our learning efforts. We analyze performance of individuals and teams in relation to impact of learning on their skills, productivity and achievement of organizational objectives. Tools like the annual engagement survey, self-assessments, mid/end of year performance reviews, provide useful data to make informed choices about future investments in learning and development. # Global Standards; Regional Empowerment\n\nThe Global People and Culture team serves as a thought partner for learning and development and focuses on initiatives that support managers. Where appropriate, the Global team may establish organization-wide standards and/or essential courses that align with our philosophy. Regional teams are responsible for adapting these standards to the specific needs and context of their teams.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HccQ++lKOlPp8H3qbFYE2jIfDOytVNU35tiMgd7sqgg="},"f9c60b0a-2842-4bf3-938a-0982c2da6ce2":{"id_":"f9c60b0a-2842-4bf3-938a-0982c2da6ce2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Na0nYubjmR3SaYaA2UmLS/9IBTwwIAMFfi33MzTrge4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6b3de022-37f9-4cac-b453-a6e4ec824c35","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"HccQ++lKOlPp8H3qbFYE2jIfDOytVNU35tiMgd7sqgg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"367db51b-79d2-4f39-a62e-1a1efd956b47","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"qni+uFWKXxs9iuJ/K+H35MHoU9P8MnVhb+hplXh3asg="}},"text":"Regional teams are responsible for adapting these standards to the specific needs and context of their teams.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nLearning is an active and continuous process. Promoting the learning and development of employees while developing a learning culture within the organization is a shared responsibility of different actors. Below are the specific responsibilities outlined as follows:\n\n- The People and Culture Global Office – responsible for providing the overarching philosophy and framework to implement learning and development initiatives. Facilitate learning opportunities that benefit large stakeholder groups across all regions (e.g, Leadership Peer Group, Managing Well course)\n- The Regional and Country Leadership Groups are responsible for providing the budgets and supporting resources to ensure achievement of learning initiatives that support the needs of the organization and employees. ---\n# AFRICA REGION\n\n# LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\n- Technical and administrative line managers are responsible for identifying learning and capacity-building needs, and providing appropriate solutions to ensure their teams have the necessary skills and support to carry out their roles and develop within Evidence Action. Line managers are responsible for ensuring learning needs are submitted to the People and Culture team based on their continuous discussions captured on their work and development plan. - Individual employee - Learning is a personally driven initiative, it is an employee’s responsibility to take ownership of their learning. They are encouraged to proactively seek creative ways to enhance their personal and professional development. They are to actively seek information on learning interventions that are relevant to improve their job performance (in collaboration with their line manager) and to engage in learning for their work enhancement and development. - The Regional and Country People and Culture Department is responsible for providing technical guidance to employees and line managers as needed and for the administration support for learning through internal or external resources. The People and Culture department shall assist to monitor the learning budget and ensure prioritization of the budget to organizational learning needs. # 4. METHODS OF LEARNING IN EVIDENCE ACTION\n\nEvidence Action shall strive to implement the 70:20:10 learning model. 70% of learning initiatives will focus on experience, 20% on exposure and 10% on education.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WRMqvU1ctso+FetVNnRKedw/LJoWgepcfkBIS9e3P6s="},"367db51b-79d2-4f39-a62e-1a1efd956b47":{"id_":"367db51b-79d2-4f39-a62e-1a1efd956b47","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Na0nYubjmR3SaYaA2UmLS/9IBTwwIAMFfi33MzTrge4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f9c60b0a-2842-4bf3-938a-0982c2da6ce2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"WRMqvU1ctso+FetVNnRKedw/LJoWgepcfkBIS9e3P6s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"88f9d6be-81ef-4f8b-a4ec-2b952b63bba5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"HMX1QNQ6D7oX1oBqIds5l9Zga25c6Dt7z0d5ZLXvxA8="}},"text":"---\n# AFRICA REGION\n\n# LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\n|Structured Courses|Peer Learning|On-the-job and situational learning|\n|---|---|---|\n|Programs|Subject matter networks|New & challenging experiences or tasks|\n|eLearning|Helping staff solve problems|Projects & special assignments|\n|Lectures/ Conferences|Informal coaching|Reading|\n|Informal mentoring|Work-related collaboration|Mobility Options|\n|Workshops|Feedback|Internal|\n|Webinars|Shadowing|1:1 Feedback|\n|Onboarding Courses|\"Buddy systems|Meeting Debriefs|\n| |Practice & Reflection|Learning of Integration-|\n| |Workplace Momentum| |\n\n# Learning\n\n|EDUCATION|EXPOSURE|EXPERIENCE|\n|---|---|---|\n|Structured Learning|Learning from Others|Learning From Experiences|\n\nThe different learning methods that can be used include:\n\n1. E-LEARNING – E-Learning is training facilitated by electronic media and educational technology. Evidence Action Academy will be utilized for induction training and other different e-learning courses. Staff are also encouraged to use other forms of e-learning available to them from time to time e.g. LinkedIn learning. 2. WORKSHOPS – A workshop is a brief and intensive type of training course intended for a relatively small group of learners and focusing on techniques and skills in a particular field. 3. MENTORING - This is a scenario where an experienced and more knowledgeable staff in a specific field guide and advises one with less experience and skill in that area. Staff can be mentored by their line managers in their specific technical areas, or any other staff in the organization where they need to improve on general business, team management or leadership skills. 4. COACHING - Partnership of two parties (a coach and coachee) in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. Unlike a mentor, a coach does not necessarily have any expertise in a specific role, rather in unlocking someone’s potential whatever that role is. Coaching is therefore usually non-directive. 5. SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING - Self-learning implies that the employee will learn by themselves while reading a document, book, protocol or when applying skills, knowledge or attitudes acquired in formal training.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qni+uFWKXxs9iuJ/K+H35MHoU9P8MnVhb+hplXh3asg="},"88f9d6be-81ef-4f8b-a4ec-2b952b63bba5":{"id_":"88f9d6be-81ef-4f8b-a4ec-2b952b63bba5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Na0nYubjmR3SaYaA2UmLS/9IBTwwIAMFfi33MzTrge4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"367db51b-79d2-4f39-a62e-1a1efd956b47","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"qni+uFWKXxs9iuJ/K+H35MHoU9P8MnVhb+hplXh3asg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e6b7b4f5-eeb7-46d1-824f-7a8d5785e026","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"OqMaLfjnjENZCP1lXvcFIyOUYSfAmRaNBmV25Rj7DMc="}},"text":"The employee is expected to study the information and to apply the newly acquired knowledge in his/her work. 6. JOB ORGANIZED INTERNAL TRAININGS – Evidence Action expects managers to provide technical training to staff in their area of specialization. For example, a Finance Manager is expected to\n---\n# AFRICA REGION\n\n# LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\nProvide finance training to finance staff and provide finance/donor regulations/budgeting and budget monitoring training to both program and support staff. # 7. ON-THE-JOB LEARNING (70% LEARNING)\n\nOn-the-job learning is a formal learning and development process during which a staff member acquires knowledge, skills, and attitudes while carrying out their job, either through peer(s) or through a line manager. The staff member can immediately apply learning, gaining competency in the real work environment and dealing with the tasks and challenges that they will meet during a normal working day. This learning is specific to the job, avoids additional costs of providing off-the-job training or losing working time. This includes job shadowing, coaching and mentorship, staff exchange/secondment etc. # 8. JOB SHADOWING/ MIRRORING\n\nThe simple act of observing more experienced colleagues followed by guided application of learning can accelerate competency acquisition; activities such as conversing, exchanging feedback, cooperating on tasks, working in acting capacity and offering mutual support when formally monitored and evaluated will deepen and solidify the learning process. # 9. EVIDENCE ACTION INTERNAL/ GLOBAL-LED TRAININGS AND WORKSHOPS\n\nStaff shall express interest or be selected by relevant management to attend global/departmental Evidence Action training such as inductions, seminars, and workshops as per the organizational guidelines including available budget, keeping in view the relevance of individual activity. Such appointments shall be validated by the country P&C Leads and Country Directors/EVP to ensure fairness in the process. # 10. PROFESSIONAL COURSES (INCLUDING CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION COURSES)\n\nThese are learning programs offered by external learning institutions that align to the specific technical or soft skills needed for the staff to perform their job. The content in this kind of learning is not curated to Evidence Action context, but useful for in depth technical learning in a certain field. # 11.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HMX1QNQ6D7oX1oBqIds5l9Zga25c6Dt7z0d5ZLXvxA8="},"e6b7b4f5-eeb7-46d1-824f-7a8d5785e026":{"id_":"e6b7b4f5-eeb7-46d1-824f-7a8d5785e026","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Na0nYubjmR3SaYaA2UmLS/9IBTwwIAMFfi33MzTrge4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"88f9d6be-81ef-4f8b-a4ec-2b952b63bba5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"HMX1QNQ6D7oX1oBqIds5l9Zga25c6Dt7z0d5ZLXvxA8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"95b15e59-1f2b-464c-96db-22d8343c393e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"cDkrGN/Ud4V3/sRUCJ4YMypIjlj/XBXjo/eJnSe317s="}},"text":"# 11. STAFF EXCHANGE, SECONDMENTS AND TRANSFERS\n\nSecondments is the temporary loan or attachment of an employee to another office/program for a specific purpose, for a defined length of time and for the benefit of all concerned. A transfer is similar to a secondment, but permanent in nature. Evidence Action endorses the use of exchange opportunities for staff in appropriate circumstances. Although there are various benefits for all parties involved, the primary objectives for exchange are:\n\n- Employee development within the job: Exchange as a mean to improve an employee’s performance in his/her original job to gain insights, additional skills through different contexts. - Career development: staff exchange as a means to enhance the level and/or scope of responsibility that an employee can bear in his/her original office/program. Staff exchange is not a method that should be used to address staff shortages and thus is not demand driven. # 5. LEARNING NEEDS ANALYSIS\n\nLearning needs analysis will be an ongoing process and not a stand alone event managed by the People and Culture Department. An annual learning and needs analysis will be conducted alongside the performance management yearly cycle and process. The line managers are responsible for having\n---\n# AFRICA REGION\n\n# LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\nKey discussions with staff to understand their learning and development needs and this will be captured on each staff performance review based on identified needs. The People and Culture Leads will supplement this with gathering organizational/team learning needs through management discussions and focus groups. The learning needs analysis process is important to align the organizational priorities outlined in Global, Regional and Country strategies, and identify gaps in employee performance and the personal development of employees. These are grouped into three areas:\n\n1. Organization and functional upskilling (Upskilling based on identified organizational and departmental/functional needs/gaps. This will also include management/leadership groups learning needs)\n2. Technical upskilling (technical skills needed to develop in one role including to enable one to accept additional relevant responsibilities)\n3. Soft skills upskilling (Learning interventions to upskill non-technical areas and general business competencies)\n\nPriority will be given to learning and development opportunities that have a direct link to the organization’s priorities and strategic objectives. The development and training needs discussed from the performance review sessions will also be considered subject to the availability of the budget.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OqMaLfjnjENZCP1lXvcFIyOUYSfAmRaNBmV25Rj7DMc="},"95b15e59-1f2b-464c-96db-22d8343c393e":{"id_":"95b15e59-1f2b-464c-96db-22d8343c393e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Na0nYubjmR3SaYaA2UmLS/9IBTwwIAMFfi33MzTrge4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e6b7b4f5-eeb7-46d1-824f-7a8d5785e026","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"OqMaLfjnjENZCP1lXvcFIyOUYSfAmRaNBmV25Rj7DMc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b0705a31-f0e0-4c62-8a75-4b5fbd8b58c3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf","file_name":"Africa Learning and Development Policy_May 2024.pdf"},"hash":"exzuDCBJlclHnpWhXdJZJi6DelEJrml/1f3DvoCPOtM="}},"text":"Staff need to note that the Organization reserves the right to approve/disapprove of a capacity-building requirement in light of budget availability and time commitment if this will affect the staff’s delivery in their current role.

Why are we doing a budget review and reforecast? We are doing a budget review and reforecast to ensure that our projections for the rest of the year are accurate and aligned with our goals and objectives. By reviewing our Q1 budget and making any necessary revisions, we can ensure that we are on track to meet our financial targets for the year. # 2. What should I do if I have questions about the budget review and reforecast process? If you have any questions or concerns about the budget review process, please don't hesitate to reach out to a member of the Global Finance or Program Finance Team. # 3. How do I budget for new funders? If you had previously budgeted activities under the Funder “99x: Funding to be Secured” and have now secured funding, your overall program budget may not change. You’ll simply need to revise the funder code from 99x to the new, secured Funder. IDC at the agreed rate on the new funder will need to be included. Please liaise with Sopeter if the new funder code is not available on the budget template. If the new Funders are funding new activities that weren’t previously budgeted, your overall budget envelope should increase. # 4. What personnel changes should be captured? There may be new hires, departing staff, or salary adjustments. These should all be captured in the budget review—details of the new salaries for existing staff will be in the salary template to be provided. Any new positions, anticipated positions, or closed positions should also be captured in the budget review. An updated salary schedule and budget review materials are provided. Please use the latest salary information found there. # 5. Do I need to provide only the changes to the budget or the full budget all over again? The full budget is needed again. You can revise your original budget for the prior period(s) to equal the actual expenses incurred or look at the budget for the year holistically and make changes to the overall amounts. # 6. What happens to the previous version of the budget? Once the revised budget is uploaded to Intacct, we will generate monthly reports based on the revised budget.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8myfdMssM6CvZYmUj2uCAvZXpMzVPva5YDNYuIX41aA="},"04483118-3119-4800-9b73-c82c8d425d13":{"id_":"04483118-3119-4800-9b73-c82c8d425d13","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Budget Review FAQ.pdf","file_name":"Budget Review FAQ.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Budget Review FAQ.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Budget Review FAQ.pdf","file_name":"Budget Review FAQ.pdf"},"hash":"UKq7wORf10Kv//n84yg/k8q+4W+l43WYTvmJYm+sL4I="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"577480cc-b7b1-4666-87a6-046c6dd95049","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Budget Review FAQ.pdf","file_name":"Budget Review FAQ.pdf"},"hash":"8myfdMssM6CvZYmUj2uCAvZXpMzVPva5YDNYuIX41aA="}},"text":"However, the original budget will still be in the system, so we maintain the ability to run reports against the original budget if needed. # 7.

Principles\n\n1. The Finance department shall record each fixed asset in the General Ledger and the Fixed Asset Record. 2. Accounting entries for fixed assets purchased with Evidence Action private or unrestricted funds are made on a cash disbursement voucher as a debit to the fixed asset account and a credit to cash. 3. Accounting entries for in-kind contributions of fixed assets from a private or grant donor are made on a general journal voucher as a debit to the fixed asset account and a credit to in-kind contributions revenue. 4. Accounting entries for fixed assets received from donors that retain ownership of the fixed assets and require donor approval for disposition at the end of awards are made on a general journal voucher as a debit to the appropriate award line item expense account and a credit to the award liability account. The liability account shall be reduced when Evidence Action recognizes revenue for the expense recorded against the donor award. # B. Capitalization\n\nEvidence Action Cameroon will capitalize fixed assets which have an expected useful life of more than one year and a value of $5,000 or more.

Establishing an Asset Record\n\nThe Asset Record shall contain the following information:\n\n- Name and description of the fixed asset\n- Cost, including purchase price, unreimbursed taxes, duties, delivery costs, and installation fees\n- Acquisition date (month and year)\n- Location\n- Employee to whom the fixed asset has been assigned or who has custodial responsibility\n- Asset number assigned by the Finance department\n- Manufacturer’s serial and/or model number\n- Estimated useful life\n- Estimated salvage value\n- Estimated depreciation value\n- Funding sources (if fixed asset acquisitions have been funded by multiple donors)\n\n# D. Calculating and Recording Depreciation\n\n1. An estimated useful life and salvage value (the best guess of the estimated value that a fixed asset will realize upon its sale at the end of its useful life) for each type of fixed asset acquired shall be designated and used to depreciate all fixed assets in that category. Local professional accounting standards or practices shall be used to determine estimated useful life and salvage value. Suggested fixed asset lives are as follows:\n---\n# Asset Management Policy\n\n# A. Asset Life\n\n- Buildings – forty (40) years\n- Leased building improvements – If the related facility lease has an automatic renewal option, the recommended asset life is forty (40) years. Otherwise, the improvements shall be depreciated over the remainder of the lease term. - No asset life shall be assigned to land nor shall land ever be depreciated. # B. Depreciation Expense\n\nDepreciation expense shall be recorded monthly on a general journal voucher as a debit to depreciation expense and a credit to accumulated depreciation. Accumulated depreciation is the sum of the depreciation expense recorded since the asset acquisition date. The depreciation entry shall terminate when the fixed asset has reached the end of its estimated useful life. The accumulated depreciation for a given fixed asset shall never exceed its cost. The fixed asset cost and the accumulated depreciation shall remain on the books until the disposal of the fixed asset. # C. Depreciation Method\n\nThe straight-line method of recording depreciation expense is recommended unless local standards or local practice dictate otherwise. The straight-line depreciation method spreads the asset’s cost evenly over its estimated useful life beginning with the month it was first placed into service. One or more expense accounts may be used to record depreciation expense in the General Ledger according to donor or other audit requirements. # D.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kk7391Zicd2C40w7jUc18P7FBQov07vCxlMdM5qPAvc="},"82aac571-8b4e-4468-8fd2-3c14a60b8be4":{"id_":"82aac571-8b4e-4468-8fd2-3c14a60b8be4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"flTrB23JdI8AMbcaJtgoYd49xpYzTQ6w9sayb50VcA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4dc4c8b1-3e96-4883-a2a0-f0dd0e15f922","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"kk7391Zicd2C40w7jUc18P7FBQov07vCxlMdM5qPAvc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"94cc7760-c2f2-435c-94cb-cf1d87cbf0bb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"LupL7Zv6OjYVvCaGV1QQL0ep95JYpKG4QRtrWSpe4fc="}},"text":"# D.

The portion of these payments that benefit future accounting periods shall be recorded as prepaid expenses. The cost of these assets is charged to expense (amortized) during the benefiting months. The Evidence Action Finance department shall maintain a detailed analysis of open prepaid expenses to facilitate their review and ensure that balances are properly amortized. B. Security deposits shall be recorded as assets but not amortized since they are not consumed and their value does not diminish over time. # B. Recording Prepaid Expenses\n\nA. The Regional Finance Lead shall determine which disbursements shall be set up as prepayments based on expenditure type. Prepayments below the minimum threshold established by the Regional Finance Lead shall be expensed when paid. The minimum threshold established by the Regional Finance Lead for prepayments shall be documented in the Delegated Authority Document. B. The Regional Finance Lead may establish separate General Ledger prepaid expense accounts for each type of prepayment or decide to record all prepayments in a single account in consultation with the CFO. If multiple types of prepayments are maintained in a single General Ledger prepaid expense account, each prepayment shall be properly amortized. # C. Maintaining Supporting Records for Prepaid Expenses\n\nA. Supporting records may be in the form of a ledger (register) or worksheet. A separate ledger or worksheet shall be maintained for each type of prepaid expense or in the case of multiple general ledger accounts. Information that shall be included in each detailed register includes:\n\n- Description of the prepayment\n---\n# Prepaid Expenses Management\n\n# A.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lcadtErTSg6haXQCbpVY56/6g7+nRpBJmBHaHIVSMPg="},"f9e989ad-d785-42e8-9854-996660bcb619":{"id_":"f9e989ad-d785-42e8-9854-996660bcb619","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"flTrB23JdI8AMbcaJtgoYd49xpYzTQ6w9sayb50VcA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5748b7f4-97b2-4f3d-a3b1-885adfeec3b5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"lcadtErTSg6haXQCbpVY56/6g7+nRpBJmBHaHIVSMPg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d6d84e86-7b3a-4ce9-a08c-b37c8ba7700c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"ALqgnQYfMiFK6yRIdaOS4m+yGiSBqo9Dli2/K4If89E="}},"text":"Prepaid Expense Register\n\n- Vendor name\n- Transaction reference number\n- Transaction date\n- Periods that will benefit from the prepayment (the term over which the prepayment is to be expensed, usually expressed as the number of months)\n- Total amount of the prepayment\n- Amount that shall be expensed (amortized) each month\n- Monthly beginning balance\n- Additions (cash disbursements)\n- Reductions (e.g., general journal entries for monthly amortizations, insurance premium refunds)\n- Monthly ending balance\n\n# B.

Amortization Example\n\nPrepaid expenses are usually amortized evenly over the benefiting periods. For example, if Evidence Action is required by contract to pay office rent one year in advance, payment shall be recorded on a cash disbursement voucher as a debit to prepaid expenses and a credit to the cash bank account. Each month during the lease term, the Finance department shall record a debit to expense and a credit to the prepaid expense account on a general journal voucher for one-twelfth of the prepaid rent.

This policy mitigates against the risk of having unauthorized names on the teacher training attendance sheets. # POLICY\n\nSelection: Random selection basis will be used to select the sample size from the teacher training attendance list. Random selection will be adopted using the Microsoft excel function. A representative from operations and program team will be present during the random selection and the process of selection documented and signed by the attendees. # 5. The Country Director, Cameroon and Regional Finance Lead will receive a report at the end of each round of payment processing including the completed call logs and the payment tracker for visibility into payments made, frequency and type of payment rejections if these have occurred, and processing time to take corrective action if necessary. # 6. In the event that the monitoring plan identifies issues with 10% or more of payments made to participants then Country Director, Cameroon and Regional Finance Lead will revert and reassess the payments for that cycle. DtWI government transfer payments will be accounted for as an expense when the funds are advanced. Signatures are recorded and that supporting documentation is saved on box for audit compliance. The Finance department will also check to make sure there are no duplicate names or account numbers included on the PAF.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"omLvnO39IIuw4Kph8KeL+eFswbnkPVSK4dNgxujCqfQ="},"19e182de-2faa-4955-bb3a-7ed16806d959":{"id_":"19e182de-2faa-4955-bb3a-7ed16806d959","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"flTrB23JdI8AMbcaJtgoYd49xpYzTQ6w9sayb50VcA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f1762434-9439-4b55-bc03-3ed6e4f12d10","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"omLvnO39IIuw4Kph8KeL+eFswbnkPVSK4dNgxujCqfQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1dd29259-5602-44b5-98e5-7c3672e238f5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"q8ewXP0yh0EqjaQ4yGZNZJrCjrhKAZXyoAesn63N0bc="}},"text":"---\n# Sample Size\n\nMinimum sample of 1 % of the whole population to be tested.

In principle as much as feasible, we shall aim to have more costs directly charged to programs at the country level. It is only for costs that are hard to attribute to a specific program either in part or as a whole, that the pooled methods come into effect. # DEFINITION OF REGIONS AND SUB-REGIONS\n\n1. Regional Africa\nThis is defined as the entire Africa Region as a continent. Evidence Action has operations in Africa and is currently in five countries. 2. East & South Africa Sub-Region Hub\nThis hub comprises the countries of Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, and other countries which may be added in the future in this hub. 3. West & Central Africa Hub\n---\n# Current Page\n\n# Hub Overview\n\nThis hub comprises the countries of Cameroon, Liberia, and other countries which may be added in the future in this hub. # POLICY\n\nAssigning expenses to projects using a methodology that is consistent and rational will provide Evidence Action management with the true cost of each project being implemented. The objective of cost allocation is to charge expenses to Evidence Action projects based on the benefit that each project receives from the expense incurred. Using documented and systematic methods to allocate shared costs shall ensure that each Evidence Action donor covers its “fair share” of allocable expenses. Allocating shared costs also helps to improve project management through a fair and reasonable distribution of allocable operational costs across all Evidence Action funding sources. An effective cost allocation system will enable Evidence Action to more accurately budget program needs. It will help Evidence Action in complying with donor regulations and assist in maintaining a consistent, reasonable, and reliable financial accounting management system. # Principles\n\nLogic shall be applied and the criteria chosen shall be justifiable when allocating shared costs to projects. The best cost drivers closely link costs incurred to project benefits received. All cost allocation methods chosen shall be fair, justifiable, and applied consistently. Cost allocation formulas shall be updated with each budget or budget review, as required to ensure that charges allocated to each project accurately reflect project activities during the period. # Steps in Implementing Cost Allocation Methodology\n\n1. Defining Cost Drivers. The “fair share” is normally calculated by defining the cost driver. 2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"q8ewXP0yh0EqjaQ4yGZNZJrCjrhKAZXyoAesn63N0bc="},"361c833a-2b6b-4b69-899d-ddbe2bf48070":{"id_":"361c833a-2b6b-4b69-899d-ddbe2bf48070","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"flTrB23JdI8AMbcaJtgoYd49xpYzTQ6w9sayb50VcA4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1dd29259-5602-44b5-98e5-7c3672e238f5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"q8ewXP0yh0EqjaQ4yGZNZJrCjrhKAZXyoAesn63N0bc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b5e42df5-7f11-4c58-9ba2-5073ddbfc383","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf","file_name":"Cameroon Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20240109.pdf"},"hash":"ahqOOkakuft3AonjxC6ryRyYlYNnD7dI9O5MHJdaiwA="}},"text":"The “fair share” is normally calculated by defining the cost driver. 2.

Cost Allocation: The process of distributing shared costs to appropriate Evidence Action projects. Regional Costs: These are pooled expenses that are incurred by the regional office for a common purpose that benefits all programs in the Africa Region. To determine the share of these costs for each program, we have to use an allocation methodology. Sub-Regional Costs: These are pooled expenses that are incurred by the sub-regional office for a common purpose that benefits all programs in the sub-Region. To determine the share of these costs for each program, we have to use an allocation methodology. # PROCEDURES\n\n# Budget Process\n\nDuring budgeting, we plan to have 3 budgets developed for each of the pools.

We have identified these costs in two parts: first, there are those that will be budgeted as a whole (NB it will be more efficient to bill these costs to the regional office and later on allocate them to the other programs). The second is a category of costs that will only cater to the regional assigned staff, with the programs, other departments, country office, and sub-region budgets covering the rest.

Also, for any costs not included in the approved annual budget, the country lead will seek approval from the Sub Hub director. In both instances the Regional finance lead and Grants Lead must be kept in copy. NB/ Saving that allows for such expenditure to be incurred must form part of the justification. Examples for such costs are:\n\n- i) Additional staff positions. - ii) New Motor Vehicles or Motorcycles. - iii) Equipment whose unit cost is more than $3,000. - iv) Renovations of more than $3,000. - v) Office relocations.

As an example for 2021, we gave this guidance, which in summary shows that we are to budget $5,700 per staff for office space, $940 per staff for payroll administration, and 4.75%, 2.7%, and 2.5% for varied budgeted amounts for Procurement & GA, F&A, and Regional Support Services. Moving into this new approach, we shall offer similar guidance, but would be based on natural general ledger accounts and will also be in three levels, i.e regional pool costs, sub-regional pool costs, and country offices pool costs. As shown in this example for illustrative purposes only, the proposed budgets will add a percentage of the total program budget as pooled Regional Costs, pooled sub-regional costs, and pooled country costs. Proportional amounts per budget FS category have been derived from respective budgets. For example, a program in Liberia will only budget for Liberia country costs, WCA sub-region costs, and Africa Regional Costs. We have developed this tool to assist budgeters in accomplishing that task by only updating row 81 and then picking rows 84-98 to update their budgets. # Shared Cost Pools\n\nUpdated February 2022\n\nThis document outlines the approaches for the following shared program costs:\n\n1.

Given the inevitability of cybersecurity incidents, it's not a question of if they will occur, but rather when. Having a comprehensive plan in place ensures that we are equipped to take swift and appropriate actions when such situations arise. # 1.1 Goals\n\n1. Safeguard the confidentiality of employee data, and uphold the integrity and accessibility of Evidence Action's systems, networks, and associated data. 2. Assist Evidence Action's staff in restoring their operational workflows following a computer or network security breach or any form of data compromise. 3. Implement a coherent response strategy to combat system and network threats that jeopardize Evidence Action's data and infrastructure. ---\n# 4. Establish and execute a communication plan encompassing initial incident reporting and ongoing updates as required. # 5. Handle legal matters pertaining to cybersecurity incidents. # 6. Coordinate closely with external Computer Incident Response Teams and law enforcement agencies. # 7. Mitigate potential damage to Evidence Action's reputation. # 1.2 Guidelines\n\nThis plan offers actionable guidelines and standard operating procedures for addressing cybersecurity incidents and data breaches effectively. It outlines the formation of a team of initial responders to such incidents, delineating clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. While primarily tailored for cyber-related incidents and breaches, this plan can also be adapted for handling data breaches unrelated to computer systems. ---\n# 2.0 Incident Response Team (IRT)\n\nOur Incident Response Team will comprise all members of the Global IT department, regional IT leads, as well as representatives from Operations, HR, and Communications.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3B9XowPxasuYxqD0ByPb6+CxpKUJFawR1aXDMmziiiE="},"c76aab74-e253-435b-9df6-9352e2ee681c":{"id_":"c76aab74-e253-435b-9df6-9352e2ee681c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"hash":"wfaTA9qyYj6/+qr8k3ZNdX8WwyDiq2nTQo49cf3lf1k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"65563fbc-0a05-48c6-aa70-49617208e904","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"hash":"3B9XowPxasuYxqD0ByPb6+CxpKUJFawR1aXDMmziiiE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a73c8bde-cfa1-4ffa-9800-586b6dea3c05","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"hash":"ghDfRbhC5/ALSTV1D8bipIz6sDzo0k0tDpynOh8ASLU="}},"text":"This team will operate across four layers, beginning with the Global IT team as the core members.

Practice exercises, commonly known as Table-top Exercises, are conducted periodically for the Incident Response Team (IRT), wherein various incident scenarios are simulated to facilitate practice sessions. Preparation activities will be spearheaded by the CSIRT coordinator and executed by the Green Team. The CSIRT coordinator will oversee the availability of all necessary resources for the team's functioning and will report to and seek approvals from the CSIRT Lead. # 3.2 Identification:\n\nThe process of confirming, characterizing, classifying, categorizing, scoping, and prioritizing suspected incidents is crucial for effective incident response. The Cybersecurity IRT coordinator will assume leadership of this process, with support from both the Global IT team and the Green Team. The CSIRT coordinator will report findings to the White and Green Teams and seek approvals from the Global Director of IT. ---\n# How an incident becomes known significantly influences the response process and its urgency. Examples of how Evidence Action becomes aware of an incident include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Automated alerts triggered by intrusion detection systems or security monitoring tools. - Reports from employees or users who notice suspicious activities or anomalies. - Notifications from third-party vendors or partners. - Analysis of system logs or network traffic revealing unusual patterns or behaviors. - External reports or notifications from law enforcement agencies or regulatory bodies. - Results of routine security assessments or penetration tests uncovering vulnerabilities or weaknesses. - Notifications from customers or clients reporting unusual or unauthorized activities related to their interactions with Evidence Action systems or services. # 3.3 Notification:\n\nThis section outlines procedures for notifying the Incident Response Team (IRT) of any incident occurrence and maintaining communication throughout the incident. It includes establishing an escalation process,\n---\n# 3.4 Containment:\n\nContainment efforts will focus on minimizing financial losses, safeguarding reputation, preventing service disruptions, and limiting the potential spread of infection. Initial communication with both internal and external stakeholders will be conducted as necessary. For incidents affecting a single user and can be resolved remotely, either the CSIRT coordinator or the Green Team will be tasked with containment measures.

The specific objectives of the evaluation have been to understand the long-term impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection with Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis as well as annual programme effectiveness in terms of reductions of infections. This report is on the overall and year 5 results of the school-based deworming programme. In year 5, 199 schools were surveyed for endline assessment and 60 schools surveyed after the fifth mass drug administration (MDA). The year 5 results were then compared with those of subsequent years for trend of infection over the years. Based on the baseline, midterm and endline surveys, the STH combined prevalence had dropped substantially from the initial level of 33.6% to 15.2% with a significant relative reduction (RR) rate of 54.9%.

The results demonstrated that POC-CCA technique performed very well to detect S. mansoni in children and indeed it yielded prevalence which were 14-fold higher than those of Kato-Katz. # Implications\n\nThe immediate relative reductions reported are as expected in a national deworming programme and are an indication that the programme is doing well. While the evaluation was not powered to detect county-level changes, results at county level shows heterogeneity in programmatic impact and may merit much more intensive programmatic interventions to get to the goal of morbidity control and transmission break. It seems that, of the STHs, children are getting re-infected with A. lumbricoides very rapidly, eroding the gains made by MDA. Additionally, not covering other age groups and non-enrolled children is likely to be leaving reservoirs of infection in those groups. Although, the evaluation was not designed to look at levels of infection in those groups, but there are indications that younger children tend to have higher moderate-to-heavy infections. Re-infections, especially with Ascaris lumbricoides, often occurs following MDAs. Other interventions such as provision of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) have to be introduced to sustain chemotherapeutic gains of MDA and to accelerate attainment of the transmission break point that could lead to possible elimination of STH as a public health problem. Our results have also shown that POC-CCA is a more sensitive method than Kato-Katz technique in detection of S. mansoni infection in low prevalence areas. ---\n# Introduction\n\nFrom the year 2012, the ministries of health and of education in Kenya started to deworm all school-age children who live in 66 districts (now sub counties) identified as having a high prevalence STH and schistosome infections to warrant MDA.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"guscWBcFDpnpyfeiSdnTZVLV0vLW/gXlT0OoitMJtdk="},"6b809428-4e6e-42d1-a724-b4fef59a8433":{"id_":"6b809428-4e6e-42d1-a724-b4fef59a8433","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"c1S38WFiB7I3Iq4jssGUEGciu0gBhGwUXz5orr4+Hgs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"200e87ba-6e9d-4c2b-a2e2-0da2258d469c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"guscWBcFDpnpyfeiSdnTZVLV0vLW/gXlT0OoitMJtdk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"26c5ed83-d26f-4aa7-9719-6fee57f9d4bf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"/ndMg1QivvwxF8S8Bu7hVcuEuD2ax0UqAqrVa5QS6J8="}},"text":"The impact of the Kenya’s school-based deworming programme, carried out in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Coast regions, was monitored for five years and included pre-post intervention and repeated cross-sectional surveys as outlined in figure 1.

Sub-counties stratification was based on both geography and anticipated infection prevalence. The programme contained two tiers of monitoring: i) a national baseline survey including 200 schools in 20 sub-counties which aims to establish an accurate national measurement of infection levels; ii) surveys conducted pre- and post-intervention (pre-post surveys), which monitor 60 of the 200 schools before and after the deworming activity to determine reduction in infections following MDA.

The results shows that\nthe programme has greatly reduced the STH infections particularly for hookworm but not to a level\nwhere it is no longer a public health concern (less than 1% prevalence), hence the need to\nincorporate other interventions alongside the preventive chemotherapy to accelerate this decline\nand perhaps achieve elimination.

This potentially warrants further exploration into the factors causing the re-infection, and probably need for frequent anthelmintic drug administration to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. # Regional Infection Levels\n\nThe programme recorded greater reduction levels in STH infections in the Coastal region, followed by Nyanza region, Western, and Rift Valley. From the results, higher chances of getting *A. lumbricoides infection is still spread across the four regions; however, despite reduction in risk associated with hookworm and T. trichiura* infections over the five years, we still established a higher risk of hookworm infection in Western region and higher odds of trichuriasis infection in Rift Valley region. We therefore call for detailed research into the continued likelihood of spread of these particular species in those specific regions. # Factors Influencing Infection Variations\n\nThe variations in the infections observed in the counties are likely to be due to specific epidemiological situation, geographical heterogeneity, initial prevalence levels/worm burden, different transmission intensities, as well as differing treatment coverage, drug uptake and compliance. # Prevalence in Younger Children\n\nWe established that parasite infections for any STH were more prevalent in younger (ECD) children than the older ones, underscoring the inadequate deworming delivered to this group.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J2r35caPazD8a4HfF3mrEdn1brG6W25ggUb9kTvQtXk="},"cbf80d76-6874-4b7d-a786-f5c9435551f2":{"id_":"cbf80d76-6874-4b7d-a786-f5c9435551f2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"c1S38WFiB7I3Iq4jssGUEGciu0gBhGwUXz5orr4+Hgs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"312bac2f-0aaf-4352-b66f-b984a79a6d60","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"J2r35caPazD8a4HfF3mrEdn1brG6W25ggUb9kTvQtXk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d7e495d3-667d-4ffb-ac7f-6c9a327c9fd3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"PCb0ByxX/BtxWRM9X0al6ObbSA64Sb4TnnbFK6gQTlQ="}},"text":"To meet the WHO target of controlling, eradication or elimination of STH infections by the year 2020, we therefore recommend that the programme be scaled up to cover the non-enrolled children, the adult population and pre-school children since they could act as reservoir for infection. # Schistosome Infections\n\nTreatment for both schistosome infections i.e. *Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium*, has not been consistent and was coupled with low coverage. This low coverage in treatment of schistosome infections has complicated the comparison of the observed prevalence and mean intensity over the five years of the programme monitoring. This challenge notwithstanding, the programme has reduced the prevalence of schistosome infections. ---\n# Current Findings on Schistosome Infections\n\nThe reduction in prevalence for both schistosome infections has been similarly varying by region and county. The results pointed out a significantly higher risk of *S. mansoni* infection in Nyanza and Western regions compared to other regions. Despite the inconsistent treatment schedule witnessed throughout the programme, our results are inconcurrent with data seen in other countries which have reported ‘hot spots’ or areas of persistent re-infection despite intensive treatment. Further, we also noted that schistosome infections were less prevalent among younger (ECD) children than the older counterparts, OR = 0.18, p=0.003, indicating a likelihood of a more serious schistosomiasis problem among the adult population. # Comparison of CCA and Kato-Katz in Evaluating *Schistosoma mansoni* Infection\n\nThe Kato-Katz technique has long been the mainstay technique in schistosomiasis diagnosis in endemic areas. However, several studies have now documented a poor Kato-Katz sensitivity in evaluating *Schistosoma mansoni especially in areas with lower rates of transmission [7–9]. Since our programme has been running for five years and has managed to reduce schistosome infections to substantially lower levels as indicated by Kato-Katz results, we found it worthwhile during the endline surveys to explore the relationship between results of the stool-based Kato-Katz technique and the urine-based POC-CCA technique for S. mansoni*. This would inform decision-making by the programme in changing from Kato-Katz to POC-CCA technique in its effort to control or interrupt transmission of schistosomiasis.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CYNKYUXv35R6irzwbm4/r1s3dUjchor+mwMtdXN8cUk="},"d7e495d3-667d-4ffb-ac7f-6c9a327c9fd3":{"id_":"d7e495d3-667d-4ffb-ac7f-6c9a327c9fd3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"c1S38WFiB7I3Iq4jssGUEGciu0gBhGwUXz5orr4+Hgs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cbf80d76-6874-4b7d-a786-f5c9435551f2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"CYNKYUXv35R6irzwbm4/r1s3dUjchor+mwMtdXN8cUk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"618661e4-33e0-48ba-85cf-5bfc999ffc50","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"0ZJZFTo3/JzV6JO0uTcekigt62sR+g9wWt5z2PMeC5k="}},"text":"From the results, *S. mansoni prevalence from POC-CCA technique were significantly higher than those from Kato-Katz technique and indeed 5-fold higher during pre-treatment and 14-fold higher during post-treatment.

Confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalence and average intensity of infections were obtained using binomial and negative binomial regression models, respectively, adjusting for school clustering. Relative reductions in prevalence and average intensity of infections were estimated by binomial regression and negative binomial regression, respectively, taking into account school clusters and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-values obtained using multivariable mixed effects models with random intercepts for schools and counties implemented in R software.

The Kato-Katz performance measures were calculated and compared with POC-CCA results, as the gold standard, at 95%CIs for sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and kappa score.

In fact, several studies suggest that in all but low transmission settings, the treatment of school-aged children alone is unlikely to drive transmission to a level where the parasites cannot persist [15]. Long-term control measures lie in concomitantly improving the quality of WASH education in schools. It is therefore recommended that post year five the programme should incorporate integrated control approaches emphasizing on health education and WASH interventions alongside the current preventive chemotherapy to drive transmission to a level where the parasites cannot persist. Our results have shown that the current single-dose albendazole being administered by the programme is not very effective in controlling T. trichuira, and we therefore suggest that either the programme to increase drug administration frequency or use drug combination to effectively control the transmission of trichuriasis infection. Possibly, the programme can also consider conducting detailed studies to accurately measure drug efficacy and to detect potential emergence of drug resistance to albendazole and praziquantel. The results revealed a significantly higher levels of STH infections among the ECD children compared to the older ones indicating that most of these infections are harboured by the non-enrolled or pre-school children.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0ZJZFTo3/JzV6JO0uTcekigt62sR+g9wWt5z2PMeC5k="},"550ba033-5963-4c08-b2ff-613024d5512e":{"id_":"550ba033-5963-4c08-b2ff-613024d5512e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"c1S38WFiB7I3Iq4jssGUEGciu0gBhGwUXz5orr4+Hgs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"618661e4-33e0-48ba-85cf-5bfc999ffc50","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"0ZJZFTo3/JzV6JO0uTcekigt62sR+g9wWt5z2PMeC5k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0ca3911a-1262-44df-ac95-dac14ccf0c3b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"J5jqSrGBdDR9y4yV7TiZqzB3BuikHYfn7Rm4TAOMz1c="}},"text":"The programme should therefore be extended to cover both non-enrolled and pre-school children as well as the adult population, to ensure coverage of the entire population. Our results found that the Kato-Katz technique is extremely of low sensitivity in areas of low prevalence, and as a result the programme should convert from Kato-Katz to POC-CCA technique in an effort to effectively control schistosomiasis. The POC-CCA uses urine instead of stool, results can be available immediately and the cost of POC-CCA is either equivalent to or less than Kato-Katz depending on bulk pricing of the cassettes purchased [7,16]. However, because the exisiting guidelines for schistosomiasis control programmes are based on Kato-Katz, the programme may need to use POC-CCA alongside Kato-Katz technique. ---\n# References\n\n1.

achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All by 2015. Attainment of Universal Primary Education depends wholly on the attention we give to the health of the school-age children. Diseases do not only affect learning negatively, but may lead to disability or loss of life. Healthy children develop into productive future citizens. Schools should therefore take great measures to prevent diseases through health education and implementation of preventive interventions. This will go a long way in poverty eradication, improved health of the citizens and thus help to realize the MDGs and other national and international goals. Ensuring that children are healthy and able to learn is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of any education system. Healthy children are able to attend school regularly and hence stabilize attendance and enhance performance. Improved health allows for better physical and cognitive development in children which eventually produces a more productive population. Sound education promotes acquisition of knowledge, good attitudes, and practices necessary for healthy living, disease prevention, and control. Our school curriculum emphasizes skill-based health education and promotion with a focus on safe water, environmental sanitation, and hygiene for worm control. The National School-Based Deworming Programme aims to eradicate parasitic worms as a public health problem in Kenya, as well as promoting good health and hygiene practices among school-age children. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology – State Department of Education will continue to collaborate with other state departments and development partners in supporting school health programmes in order to achieve quality education. # Remarks by Mrs. Margaret Okemo, Director Basic Education, State Department of Education, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\n\nii                                                                   Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# Message from the Ministry of Health\n\nSchool-aged children make up 42% of the total population. They suffer varying but significant degrees of ill health resulting in nutrition deficiencies and morbidity that unequivocally impede effective learning and realization of their full productive potential.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sqvuiQAg+YfhgX5B41hUxwGQ4htOY7EpZOLNmkQWyA0="},"4135c685-d993-45ef-bfd6-ed7b2d6b5ba3":{"id_":"4135c685-d993-45ef-bfd6-ed7b2d6b5ba3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"CXqa3uFo6TFSEg8X6Mf46/vBue8fsSP7px2qkaGMk+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10cb7a82-6512-4992-94a7-6ff3a1826d05","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"sqvuiQAg+YfhgX5B41hUxwGQ4htOY7EpZOLNmkQWyA0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c6e4d631-c55d-4fba-90bd-db40538b1463","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"cX/+h/kgKdqoXCAIv0pqAgDI3rvhrDlMqtIWLuOVRJg="}},"text":"The ill health is partly due to poor sanitation, unsafe drinking water, factors related to lack of hygiene, parasitic infections, macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, HIV infections and other sexually transmitted infections. Schistosomiasis and Soil Transmitted Helminthiases (STHs) infections affect children more than other populations. These infections give rise to much suffering and death. In addition, they contribute to the perpetuation of poverty by impairing the cognitive performance, growth of children, reduced work capacity and productivity potential when adults. Approximately 16.6 million people are at risk of Soil Transmitted Helminthes (STHs) infection in Kenya, with 7 million children affected. About 6 million people are estimated to be at risk of Schistosomiasis infection in Kenya with about 70% being between the ages 5-14 years. The STHs (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms) are estimated to infect over 1 billion individuals worldwide. In 2010, 5.18 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were lost as a consequence of STH infections and Schistosomiasis contributed to loss of 3.31 million DALYs. Chronic infections can have insidious effects on childhood development, including growth and cognitive development. Both chronic (anemia, malnutrition, and intestinal obstruction) and high intensity infections are most common in school-age children who are the natural targets for school-based deworming programme. In 2001, the World Health Assembly endorsed the WHA 54.19 resolution. It urged countries to control morbidity due to STH infection through regular deworming of school-aged children, setting a target to deworm 75% of the school children. The National School-Based Deworming Programme was launched by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in 2009 to control Soil-transmitted Helminthes and Schistosomiasis. About 3.6 million school age children from 8,218 primary schools in 45 districts were dewormed using Albendazole. This programme was modeled on the previous pilot programmes in Kenya.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dB34nnrQzNmn2xOEa8bMiN+Bnu2SrXGib5wdJxCiB2s="},"c6e4d631-c55d-4fba-90bd-db40538b1463":{"id_":"c6e4d631-c55d-4fba-90bd-db40538b1463","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"CXqa3uFo6TFSEg8X6Mf46/vBue8fsSP7px2qkaGMk+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4135c685-d993-45ef-bfd6-ed7b2d6b5ba3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"dB34nnrQzNmn2xOEa8bMiN+Bnu2SrXGib5wdJxCiB2s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8d6b817d-18b9-4f7d-ba65-1f4a0c81f990","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"WifDHW+c7yI+zLBaMSyL1Wm3yAW79GNYTe2NrX/M53E="}},"text":"This programme was modeled on the previous pilot programmes in Kenya. This includes a Programme in Mwea District in Central Kenya supported by the Eastern and Southern Africa Centre of International Parasite Control (ESACIPAC) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, together with other line ministries and development partners have put in place a policy framework. This is to reduce the disease burden emanating from infestation of worms among children in and out of school. Five million children of 2-14 years of age are targeted by National School-Based Deworming Programme annually. Due to the collaborative effort between the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, school-aged children in 112 sub-counties, have successfully been dewormed in Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley and Coast Regions. The Ministry of Health provides leadership and quality public health and sanitation. While the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology coordinates resource mobilization to support the Programme. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Children’s Investment Fund Foundation for providing funds to support the Programme and Deworm the World Initiative for technical and administrative support. The two ministries (MoH and MoEST) will continue to provide leadership, human resource, provision of deworming drugs and logistics management.

It is also committed to the Country’s developmental blueprint, Vision 2030, which aims to provide high quality life to all citizens by year 2030, and Millennium Development Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education. Therefore, through the National School-Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP), the Government seeks to improve the health and education status of its children and secure Kenya’s future. In Kenya, worms affect an estimated 5 million school-aged children. Due to the negative impact of these worms on children’s health and education, the Government of Kenya launched the NSBDP in 2009, wherein 3.6 million children were dewormed. The Programme’s objective is to eradicate parasitic worms as a public health problem in Kenya and aims to treat at least 5 million Kenyan children each year for at least five years (2012-2016) in all areas that meet the World Health Organization (WHO) prevalence threshold for mass drug administration.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WifDHW+c7yI+zLBaMSyL1Wm3yAW79GNYTe2NrX/M53E="},"15ec880c-791b-419d-a0ac-15f378f9141f":{"id_":"15ec880c-791b-419d-a0ac-15f378f9141f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"CXqa3uFo6TFSEg8X6Mf46/vBue8fsSP7px2qkaGMk+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8d6b817d-18b9-4f7d-ba65-1f4a0c81f990","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"WifDHW+c7yI+zLBaMSyL1Wm3yAW79GNYTe2NrX/M53E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c2dd9a2a-cc19-46fa-9a9f-12ecdd1e26aa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"s5t6rtbtdrCWAtDZK5Dei7ToTFP0z71WSbaFsVmqjTo="}},"text":"The NSBDP is implemented by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical assistance from Deworm the World Initiative (DtWI).

Worms, or minyoo in Swahili, are parasites that live in the human intestines and bladder. There are two types of worms treated by the NSBDP: soil-transmitted helminthes (STH or common worms) and schistosomiasis (bilharzia). Worm infection is a chronic condition that threatens children’s health and limits their access to education.

Because worms negatively affect children’s health and education, deworming children helps them grow and stay healthy and also improves their educational attainment. The benefits of deworming are immediate, long lasting and have a wide reach. Deworming positively impacts the children who receive treatment, as well as their siblings and other children who live nearby. # Why School-Based Deworming? School-aged children typically have the highest intensity of worm infection of any age group, and because they are growing, they are the most at risk. School-based deworming reaches children where they are – at school. Schools offer a readily available, extensive and sustained infrastructure that makes the programme cost-effective. Additionally, schools are equipped with a skilled workforce that is in close contact with the community. # Evidence of Impact:\n\n# How Does School-Based Deworming Benefit Children? Results from rigorous, long-term studies conducted in Kenya evaluating school-based deworming demonstrate the long-lasting benefits of deworming. Deworming children reduces school absenteeism by 25% and increases literacy (children persistently infected with worms are 13% less likely to be literate when they are adults). Due to spillover effects, deworming also dramatically improves cognition in untreated younger siblings that is equivalent to half a year of schooling. Additionally, adults who are dewormed as children earn wages over 20% higher than their untreated counterparts. Worms can be transmitted by walking or playing barefoot in contaminated soil or water. ---\n# NSBDP Policy Framework\n\nThe NSBDP is embedded in several existing policies adopted by the Government of Kenya. These policies ensure its alignment with GoK priorities and infrastructure that ensure the sustainability of the programme. # The National School Health Policy and Guidelines\n\nAdopted by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health in 2009, it defines school-based mass deworming as an effective preventive and treatment measure against worms. The policy states, “Treatment shall be administered to all school-age children, including those out of school, based on the prevalence and intensity of worms and bilharzias in the area. ” (pg.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"s5t6rtbtdrCWAtDZK5Dei7ToTFP0z71WSbaFsVmqjTo="},"cb0332c4-4699-4184-aed7-2a2558b5d797":{"id_":"cb0332c4-4699-4184-aed7-2a2558b5d797","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"CXqa3uFo6TFSEg8X6Mf46/vBue8fsSP7px2qkaGMk+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c2dd9a2a-cc19-46fa-9a9f-12ecdd1e26aa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"s5t6rtbtdrCWAtDZK5Dei7ToTFP0z71WSbaFsVmqjTo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"667459d1-74ec-4e03-b2d5-045d7a8766c3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"KHTDzve21sqiHlMOum+C/JztmkIInsZUWMFWQAqBplY="}},"text":"” (pg. 32)\n\n# The National-Multi-Year Strategic Plan for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, 2011-2015\n\nLaunched in 2011, it lays the basis for a comprehensive strategy for the integration of neglected tropical disease control efforts. In this Strategic Plan, school-based deworming is identified as one of the treatment strategies for the control of worms and bilharzia. The NSBDP is one of the initiatives under the National School Health Programme at the Ministries of Health and Education, which is an integrated set of planned, school-based strategies, activities, and services to promote the health and educational development of pupils and the health of the community. # Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# Implementing the National School-Based Deworming Programme\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme uses a cascade implementation model that efficiently and cost-effectively delivers trainings, deworming drugs, monitoring forms, funds, and other program materials and resources from the National level to schools. # At the National level\n\nThe Programme engages and trains personnel from MoEST, MoH and KEMRI as Master Trainers, requisitions drugs through the MoH, and develop treatment and implementation strategies, training materials and monitoring tools. Thereafter, an initial stakeholders’ meeting is held with County and District leadership. This meeting is followed by two levels of trainings on how to successfully implement the Deworming Programme: District and Teacher Trainings. Embedded at each training level are key community sensitization messages targeted at building community awareness of the importance and benefits of child deworming. After training, the critical day of implementation occurs – Deworming Day – where teachers administer deworming treatment to millions of children in over 10,000 schools across Kenya and fill in monitoring forms capturing the treatment. These forms and any unused drugs are then moved up through a “Reverse Cascade” as described below. # The Cascade model\n\nThe Cascade model helps to manage the National scale of the NSBDP, and therefore, builds capacity for successful implementation. Additionally, the Cascade brings together MoEST and MoH personnel through collaborative leadership responsibilities for the planning, implementation and monitoring of Programme activities at all levels.

In the 45 schools assessed for schistosomiasis, initial data indicates there was a 29% reduction in prevalence. These results from the pre-post survey demonstrate a widespread reduction of prevalence of STH and schistosomiasis amongst a majority of the observed districts, which demonstrates the efficacy of deworming treatment. The table below details the prevalence of STH and schistosomiasis before and after deworming for the observed districts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cjG+KWvCACYiqvTwsbC0N0WdrGER06a/MizaocFuYg4="},"c3a56404-b765-4888-b7bf-dfa6d3468a3c":{"id_":"c3a56404-b765-4888-b7bf-dfa6d3468a3c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"CXqa3uFo6TFSEg8X6Mf46/vBue8fsSP7px2qkaGMk+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fd30d4d1-a097-44f5-b811-2a8b9c62b47a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"cjG+KWvCACYiqvTwsbC0N0WdrGER06a/MizaocFuYg4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dbdfadaf-9168-4033-bddb-f4e814e84555","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 1 Treatment Results Booklet_2013.pdf"},"hash":"dsM0uPPnhxWqfFpt/NGqFozIbXGDm92QGrxakwe4C90="}},"text":"# PREVALENCE OF STH & SCHISTOSOMIASIS: PRE and POST DEWORMING TREATMENT\n\n|REGION|DISTRICT| |STH| |SCHISTOSOMIASIS|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|COAST|Kilindini|20%|0%| | |\n| |Kwale|26%| |18%| |\n| |Malindi|33%| |19%| |\n| |Msambweni|37%| |17%| |\n| |Taita|3%| |0%| |\n| |OVERALL COAST|23%| |11%| |\n|NYANZA|Gucha|47%| |0%| |\n| |Homa Bay|31%| |5%| |\n| |Kisumu East|18%|2%| | |\n| |Masaba|40%|1%| | |\n| |Rachuonyo|32%|0%| | |\n| |Kuria East|22%| |0%| |\n| |OVERALL NYANZA|32%| |1%| |\n|RIFT VALLEY|Bomet|32%| |0%| |\n| |Kericho|32%| |0%| |\n| |Trans Mara|54%| |0%| |\n| |OVERALL RIFT VALLEY|39%| |0%| |\n|WESTERN|Bungoma East|43%| |0%| |\n| |Bunyala|27%| |26%| |\n| |Busia|36%|0%| | |\n| |Emuhaya|55%| |0%| |\n| |Kakamega Central|50%|0%| | |\n| |Lugari|36%| |0%| |\n| |OVERALL WESTERN|41%| |4%| |\n\nKwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo!

technical assistance of several partner organizations. # Deworm the World Initiative (DtWI)\n\nExemplifies Evidence Action’s focus on scaling proven development interventions and crafting sustainable models for successful implementation. The initiative aims to launch, strengthen and sustain national, government led school-based deworming programmes globally. By building capacity within governments to enable their management and financing of deworming programmes, DtWI is helping governments maximize impact of treatment to improve the health, education, and future earning of children. To date, DtWI currently reaches more than 43 million children in 27 countries. DtWI is proud to be working with the Government of Kenya on the expansion of the National School-Based Deworming Programme. The Programme was first launched in 2009 with DtWI’s technical assistance wherein 3.6 million children were dewormed. The NSBDP currently reaches more than 5 million Kenyan children annually. For more information about DtWI and the National School-Based Deworming Programme, please visit www.dewormtheworld.org. # Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)\n\nIPA is a non-profit organization dedicated to discovering and promoting effective solutions to global poverty problems. Established in 2002, IPA partners with researchers at top universities and implementing organizations around the world to ensure that poverty-fighting activities are supported by rigorous evaluation, and we work closely with local decisionmakers in key countries to ensure that the high-quality evidence is applied at scale.

inter-ministerial, government-led initiative that has proven successful in providing annual deworming treatments to millions of children at-risk for parasitic worm infection. In 2012, marking the initial scale-up of school-based deworming, the Ministries of Health and Education together set out to treat at least 5.5 million children per year for soil-transmitted helminths and have exceeded their target year after year.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"a6/e73AUsceIEXl1qRoQsMlHY+azzcC1VuPp/q3liHg="},"9b8c2972-22f5-40e5-9ae8-1165d5da5ce1":{"id_":"9b8c2972-22f5-40e5-9ae8-1165d5da5ce1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ZZI0hLFn1+Y3BOnwOvv1NLCeDUlYD/4du4H0b5v90oE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3aa0dfda-3c2c-4e02-879a-2c02d04afd6a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"a6/e73AUsceIEXl1qRoQsMlHY+azzcC1VuPp/q3liHg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2229e5a4-fcc9-430f-bfb5-3c81b3764475","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"9tNQHKNEV1GprGDl8ol/Bp7qwAUzOJFmwZhNjIX592k="}},"text":"The programme goal is to eliminate parasitic worm infection as a public health problem in Kenya and it is on its way to achieving the World Health Organisation’s 2030 disease targets as set within the WHO road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021−2030. Over the last 10 years of implementation (2012-2022), NSBD Programme targeted over six million children aged 2-14 years across 27 at-risk counties for annual treatment against worm infection; soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis. The twenty-seven counties endemic for soil-transmitted helminthiasis are spread across Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Coast, North Eastern, Eastern, and Central Regions, with 15 of the total 27 co-endemic for schistosomiasis. During the programme scale-up and maintenance phase, treating children through schools provides the greatest opportunity to reach a high proportion of the at-risk population while minimizing costs by using existing infrastructure. School-based deworming effectively reaches over 80% of the target population -children aged 2-14 regardless of school enrolment- in all at-risk geographies in the country. Trained and trusted primary school teachers administer deworming medicines annually ensuring medicines are appropriately taken. The Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) within the Ministry of Health, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and the School Health, Nutrition and Meals (SHNM) Unit within the Ministry of Education lead, coordinate, and monitor NSBD at the national level, with technical support from Deworm the World Initiative at Evidence Action. Detailed planning and programme implementation is conducted at the county level with personnel from the two ministries playing a joint leadership role to ensure that the programme is implemented in every school within the targeted treatment areas. # Impact of Deworming: The Evidence\n\nRigorous evidence shows that mass deworming is a cost-effective solution that transforms the lives of children over the short and long term. Deworming treatment leads to significant weight gains and allows more energy to be focused on child growth and development. A study in Uganda, for example, found that deworming increased child weight by 10% for children who received treatment twice per year, and by 5% for children who received treatment annually. School-based mass deworming has also been shown to reduce school absenteeism more cost-effectively than alternative ways of increasing school attendance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ySgbERCHHMGBNBFUnM9dWROGLKFbdXyQqhIP4bGhiiw="},"2229e5a4-fcc9-430f-bfb5-3c81b3764475":{"id_":"2229e5a4-fcc9-430f-bfb5-3c81b3764475","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ZZI0hLFn1+Y3BOnwOvv1NLCeDUlYD/4du4H0b5v90oE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9b8c2972-22f5-40e5-9ae8-1165d5da5ce1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ySgbERCHHMGBNBFUnM9dWROGLKFbdXyQqhIP4bGhiiw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e9a2d9fe-f3b5-4287-b531-9fd7152c423e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"nbsv9hpZsh8Hn1+NSOC2tuiNIYy/zzBMKoQPDlffIDw="}},"text":"In Kenya, school-based mass deworming reduced school absenteeism by 25% for those in treatment schools. Furthermore, deworming has spill over effects for untreated school-age and pre-school children. In Kenya, young siblings of those treated, as well as children who lived near treatment schools but were too young to be dewormed, showed gains in cognitive development equal to half a year of schooling when evaluated ten years later. The impact of deworming on children goes beyond health and education outcomes. A landmark study published in 2020, led by Edward Miguel and Nobel laureate Michael Kremer, offers new evidence of the long-term benefits of school-based deworming. According to the study, which followed a group of Kenyan students every 5 years over a 20-year period, receiving two to three additional years of deworming increased their income by 13% and consumption by 14% decades after treatment. An extra two to three years of deworming treatments in school also significantly increased the likelihood (by 9%) of working outside of agriculture and in urban areas, which presents more opportunities for jobs that largely pay better and offer more opportunities for growth. The study also calculated that the investment in deworming Kenya’s children has so far had a 37% annualised rate of return. # References\n\n1.

University of California, Berkeley\n---\n# National School Based Deworming Programme: Y10 (2021-2022) Treatment Results\n\n# Implementing the National School-Based Deworming Programme: The Cascade\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme uses a cascade implementation model that efficiently and cost-effectively delivers training, deworming medicine, and programme materials from the national level to schools. The cascade brings together personnel from the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Health (MOH) for collaborative leadership in planning, training, implementation, and monitoring of programme activities at all levels. # COUNTY SENSITIZATION AND PLANNING MEETINGS\n\nCounty Directors of Education and Health convene sensitisation meetings on the programme. This allows the programme to gain buy-in and build partnerships with county-level leaders. Over time, the counties have taken up the responsibilities of renting meeting venues and provision of projectors. # TRAINING\n\nMaster trainers, nominated from MOE and MOH personnel, are responsible for training sub-county and zone/ward-level personnel on managing and implementing the programme. Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) / Community Health Assistants (CHAs) also attend this training to learn how to support community mobilisation, support schools during the deworming day and manage any potential (but rare) serious adverse events (SAEs) that may result from the deworming medication. Initially, CHEWs would attend 2 days of sub-county training but they now attend on only the first day, which covers information about worms and the administration of deworming tablets, whereas day 2 focuses on planning. # COMMUNITY SENSITISATION AND MOBILISATION\n\nBefore deworming day, health workers and teachers share key messages with children, parents, and local leaders, encouraging community members to bring their children for deworming. Posters are put up in schools and strategic community locations to inform and emphasise the importance of deworming, how to prevent infections and the date and location of treatment. Previously, town announcers disseminated these key messages, but after feedback that radio would likely reach a wider audience, the programme piloted and adopted radio advertising.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nbsv9hpZsh8Hn1+NSOC2tuiNIYy/zzBMKoQPDlffIDw="},"90dca38e-7373-4b30-9875-92abe3791304":{"id_":"90dca38e-7373-4b30-9875-92abe3791304","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ZZI0hLFn1+Y3BOnwOvv1NLCeDUlYD/4du4H0b5v90oE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e9a2d9fe-f3b5-4287-b531-9fd7152c423e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"nbsv9hpZsh8Hn1+NSOC2tuiNIYy/zzBMKoQPDlffIDw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"81735263-5b90-499f-a18d-4e60a9a76fc4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"bpKmHzzj9pqSwCXCxVhNiuuGIsky3KD1G9cFC/WJAcQ="}},"text":"# DEWORMING DAY\n\nOn the designated County deworming day, teachers administer deworming medicine to children aged 2-14 years in public and private primary schools, as well as in nearby Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) centres. Children 2-14 years of age that are not attending school can access deworming medicines by going to the nearest primary school for treatment. Teachers fill out treatment forms to record the number of children treated. These forms have been revised several times to match MOH requirements for data entry into DHIS, a health management information system. MOH personnel visit schools to support and monitor drug administration and manage any serious adverse events that might occur. # REVERSE CASCADE\n\nOnce the deworming exercise is complete, Curriculum Support Officers (CSOs) collect 2 copies of the school summary treatment data forms from the schools, summarise them on division summary form, and hand all forms over to the Sub-County Directors of Education (SCDEs). The SCDEs collate the data onto the sub-county summary, then pass along a copy to the Sub County Medical Officer for Health (SCMOH) for data entry by Health Records and Information Officers (HRIOs), and send a copy (alongside school and division summaries) to the national secretariat. In Y10 however, in line with sustainability goals, teachers entered data into The National Education Management Information System (NEMIS) at the school level, a web-based data management system. HRIOs then uploaded this data into a DHIS instance created for the programme. # Role of ECD Teachers\n\nOf note is the role that the ECD teachers play in ensuring that the target population is reached. In a study done in the Coastal region of Kenya*, it was noted that some ECD centers were as far as 7km from the nearest primary school. Considering the age of learners in ECD centers, it was noted that some children miss out on deworming because they cannot cover this distance. The study proposed that ECD teachers, being a potential resource to the programme, should be empowered to administer deworming medicines. The same was adopted in Y9 (2020-2021) and has indeed resulted in better reach of pre-school age children. *Njomo, D.W., Masaku, J., Odhiambo, G. et al.

Sessions were able to run on time\n- Sufficient numbers of community health assistants with sufficient materials to sensitise the community, resulting in many out-of-school children being reached\n- Stakeholders such as parents, the religious fraternity, county governments, and the provincial administration continued to show significant support for the programme\n- The introduction of data entry at the school and sub-county levels into the NEMIS and DHIS systems respectively was an important step towards full government ownership\n- NEMIS and HRIO training was done beforehand and support was offered until the end of the exercise. Some sub-counties reported 100% of their schools in both systems quite soon after deworming and it was deemed an overall success\n\n# Challenges\n\n- There were some delays in the submission of treatment data forms from the schools to the sub-counties, resulting in a delay in the entry of data by the HRIOs into DHIS\n- Head teachers experienced challenges when entering data into NEMIS, ranging from not being tech-savvy to experiencing internet connectivity challenges.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bpKmHzzj9pqSwCXCxVhNiuuGIsky3KD1G9cFC/WJAcQ="},"1d9de291-4eab-433a-b259-ae4c2c3858c9":{"id_":"1d9de291-4eab-433a-b259-ae4c2c3858c9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis

entering deworming data into NEMIS\n- ECDEs and private schools were not well mapped which led to some logistical complications and institutions missing out on deworming either partially or entirely\n- There were also schools that had not been planned for which turned up for teacher training sessions and requested to be included during deworming\n- Some school enrolment numbers were not available at the time of planning during the sub-county training, so the information had to be sought later\n- While deworming tablets were delivered on time and in the right quantities for the most

parasitological analysis, implementation research, and impact evaluation. KEMRI’s Eastern and Southern Africa Centre of International Parasite Control (ESACIPAC) has conducted repeat cross-sectional school-level surveys assessing prevalence and intensity for three types of STH (hookworm, whipworm—specifically Trichuris trichiura, and roundworm—specifically Ascaris lumbricoides) and schistosome infections (Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium) in school-age children. Results from this work guide programme decisions and help NSBD maintain its evidence-based approach. During year 9 of the NSBD programme implementation, KEMRI performed a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) survey in 200 schools in the 27 NSBD counties spread across six regions of the country. The survey design and analysis were based on a novel approach - model-based geostatistics (MBG) - of sampling children and schools to give a geospatially representative sample of schools within each county. The results showed that after 10 years of consistent deworming, the overall prevalence of STH reduced to 5.8%, from a baseline of 32.3%, an 82.0% rate reduction, and approaching WHO recommended prevalence levels for treatment suspension (less than 2%). Species specific prevalences were 4.3% for Ascaris lumbricoides, 1.4% for Trichuris trichiura and 0.3% for hookworm. Importantly, after 10 years of deworming, the prevalence of moderate or heavy intensity infections (as indicated by the total number of worms within an individual child) is now below 2%, indicating a very low level of morbidity associated with STH in the NSBD area. This metric, defined by the WHO, indicates that a geography has Eliminated STH infection as a Public Health Problem (EPHP). The average NSBD intensity covers 19 counties with intensity below 2%, however, 8 which are yet to reach this threshold. The trend in overall prevalence from baseline to Y9 evaluation is shown in figure 1 below.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pbgtsNhWln1/yenYN/A3BctD6RDhhihg44pJC+paBRg="},"da6e5652-45b7-4c5c-be0c-23d0b346230a":{"id_":"da6e5652-45b7-4c5c-be0c-23d0b346230a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ZZI0hLFn1+Y3BOnwOvv1NLCeDUlYD/4du4H0b5v90oE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bdde5649-1e04-4722-8755-040164b208c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"pbgtsNhWln1/yenYN/A3BctD6RDhhihg44pJC+paBRg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a14e8560-e469-430a-bb4f-35666a3e4cb4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"fY3kLbz3KgFI8HI8kA8xYu9YAVAgaTs52FNkuS4n4R8="}},"text":"The trend in overall prevalence from baseline to Y9 evaluation is shown in figure 1 below. |Survey|Overall Prevalence|Ascaris lumbricoides|Trichuris trichiura|Hookworm|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Baseline|32.3%|4.3%|1.4%|0.3%|\n|Y10|5.8%|4.3%|1.4%|0.3%|\n\nFigure 1: Showing trend in STH overall prevalence since baseline\n\nAfter 10 years of deworming, the overall schistosomiasis prevalence is 3.0% for Schistosoma mansoni and 2.2% for Schistosoma haematobium.

We noted a slight increasing trend in schistosome prevalence which requires further investigation. Due to the varying levels of infections in each county and the over ten years of NSBD annual treatment delivery strategy, the programme should adopt county-level treatment frequencies (or consider lower geographic demarcation to sub-county) based on the WHO prevalence categorization. When considering county level treatment frequencies, 10 and two counties may consider suspending treatment for STH and SCH respectively. In addition, 10 and 22 counties may consider treatment once every two years for STH and SCH respectively. Considering treatment frequency has been annual up until this point of the program, this represents a considerable reduction in resources due to the success of the program. ---\n# National School Based Deworming Programme: Y10 (2021-2022) Treatment Results\n\n# Integration of Treatment Data into NEMIS and DHIS\n\n# Introduction\n\nData collection and entry have evolved to accommodate the changing needs of programme stakeholders.

The HRIOs input the data into a DHIS instance created for the programme. This improved reverse cascade process has resulted in:\n\n- an increase in accuracy of data. This was due to the validation rules that were in place in the systems\n- reduced delivery timelines. We were able to get data from a huge proportion of the schools in the first 2 weeks as the responsible teams had access to the systems and data entry happened right after deworming\n- greater accessibility by stakeholders to the treatment data.

Every school in a county must be registered by the County Director of Education on the NEMIS platform and receive a Unique Institution Code (UIC) that serves as their institution’s NEMIS Code. Headteachers must update all information about the school and register every learner. In 2020 and 2021, data from the sub-county was entered by NEMIS officers into Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) a data collection platform for the programme. The system was used as a means to collect data electronically as we explored other data collection options. NEMIS was officially adopted in Y10 where head teachers were trained on a web-based and an android application for data entry. To enter Form MOH517C, an instance in NEMIS was created.

The Sub-County directors were given the permissions to add the unregistered schools (both ECDE and Primary) under a new instance created specifically for the program so as to collect data from all schools. Data entry was monitored in the system by the SCDE and NEMIS officers within their respective sub-counties. # DHIS\n\nAll stakeholders within the NSBD have worked over the years to improve on the processes of data collection, analysis and presentation geared towards data-informed decision making. Various options were piloted to counter the challenges around quality and timely availability of treatment data to stakeholders at all levels. HRIOs were trained on electronic entry of data into CSPro for the programme in Y8 (2019-2020) and Y9 (2020-2021) and this was not without its challenges. It became increasingly necessary to implement the entry of deworming data into the DHIS system to improve on timelines for Cabinet Secretary (CS) and Principal Secretary (PS) performance contract reporting as well as timely availability of data to all stakeholders. # System Overview\n\nDistrict Health Information Software (DHIS) is a web-based software package built with free and open-source frameworks for collection, validation, analysis and presentation of aggregate data. It is a generic tool that needs configuration in every new context-implementation. Its core features make it ideal to support in the collection of deworming data at the school level including the provision to either be in standard lists or tables or to be customised to replicate paper forms. This makes the transition from paper to DHIS easier. Within DHIS there are different data validation tools that can be used to ensure data received is of good quality.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U1mGtK4ZfHBBa024dS8gWfF8hQ2GHAdOHbQ8v0ym5nY="},"0be5a75b-d1bd-4daa-aa5b-2394455132bc":{"id_":"0be5a75b-d1bd-4daa-aa5b-2394455132bc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ZZI0hLFn1+Y3BOnwOvv1NLCeDUlYD/4du4H0b5v90oE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c582b57d-7665-441d-b229-9b13bba41518","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"U1mGtK4ZfHBBa024dS8gWfF8hQ2GHAdOHbQ8v0ym5nY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"024e939b-5b86-428d-93ab-745310e32d16","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"5mQzgYQ7E/BETEMvlJwvicCXv0PTAM6WI4BiDFlMsao="}},"text":"In addition, DHIS provides easy to use one-click reports with charts and tables for selected indicators or summary reports using the design of the data collection tools and allows for integration with popular external report design tools to add more custom or advanced reports. These reports are supported by the comprehensive data management system that DHIS offers, supporting analysis at the different levels from school level all the way to the national level. # Data Entry into DHIS Process\n\nThe Division of Health Informatics team from the Ministry of Health alongside Evidence Action undertook the creation and customization of the form MOH517C into DHIS. This was done as below:\n\n- School List Cleaning and Uploading: A comprehensive list of registered schools provided by the Ministry of Education was uploaded into the system before development and deployment. Schools that had been deworming but were not registered were also identified and updated. This inadvertently provided an opportunity for the Ministry of Education to push for these schools to register. - Integrating form MOH517C into DHIS: The Ministry of Health took the lead in replicating the form MOH517C into DHIS and it was designed to mimic the paper form. The form was split into STH and SCH forms to track both and a form was assigned to each school as data entry was happening at the school level. In addition to the treatment numbers, Head teacher details were collected for ease of follow up as necessary.

Some sections such as the totals were auto-filled by the system to reduce data entry errors as well as the time taken to fill the forms. - Creation of reports in DHIS: Key indicators were identified and programmed into the systems. These were then collated and reports at the different levels were generated. These reports included submission rates as well as dashboards showcasing the treatment numbers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8TczPoXr42oi7fGyCD4mch0aFGYlWAVqU0Flst5BA6U="},"024e939b-5b86-428d-93ab-745310e32d16":{"id_":"024e939b-5b86-428d-93ab-745310e32d16","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"ZZI0hLFn1+Y3BOnwOvv1NLCeDUlYD/4du4H0b5v90oE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0be5a75b-d1bd-4daa-aa5b-2394455132bc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"8TczPoXr42oi7fGyCD4mch0aFGYlWAVqU0Flst5BA6U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fcf0efbe-c54f-4f18-be4e-8f21b0a9411a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 10 Treatment Results Booklet_2022.pdf"},"hash":"AfduRsMDYsk7rhLXn3nNJ8FJekuDWFKBvAf5NQvGQaA="}},"text":"These reports included submission rates as well as dashboards showcasing the treatment numbers. 5,056,465\n*\n156,640.5\n12,458\n\nFig 2: Dashboard showing treatment reach (children, sub-counties, and schools) and the disaggregation by gender, age, and enrolment\n\nFig 3: Tabular format of the treatment numbers at the county level\n\n# Training of end users and roll-out\n\nThe HRIOs at the sub-counties are responsible for data entry into the system and were invited for training on the same at the County. Each county training took one day and was spearheaded by the health informatics team and supported by Evidence Action team. The training was fairly smooth as the team had prior knowledge of the DHIS system. Unique login credentials for each county and sub-county were provided during the training. About a week after the deworming exercise was completed, data started trickling in, first into NEMIS for about a month and then into DHIS. When data entry into DHIS commenced, there was a spike in the number of schools that had data entered into DHIS. In the 3rd and fourth weeks post commencement of data entry into NEMIS, data entry slowed down significantly. In 2023, with lessons learned we expect to have smoother roll out with HRIOS having already been familiarised with the systems. * Data entry for Y10 was done at the school level by MOE into NEMIS and sub county level by MOH into DHIS. The numbers in DHIS do not indicate the final reported treatment numbers as some schools reported on NEMIS but not on DHIS. A data comparison was therefore done to come up with the final reported numbers that are higher than those reported in the DHIS instance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5mQzgYQ7E/BETEMvlJwvicCXv0PTAM6WI4BiDFlMsao="},"fcf0efbe-c54f-4f18-be4e-8f21b0a9411a":{"id_":"fcf0efbe-c54f-4f18-be4e-8f21b0a9411a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis

Programme\n\n# Year 2 Report\n\n# (April 2013 - March 2014)\n---\n# Message from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\n\nWe celebrate its success in treating the 6.4 million children in over 15,000 schools in the 28 counties. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology supports the goal of universal access to basic education. To this extent, it is committed to the Dakar Framework for Action on Education for All (EFA) and the Millennium Development Goals. The government's free primary and secondary education initiative is in line with these international commitments. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology supports all programmes that promote both access and quality of education in this country. The National School Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP) is one such important initiative. Through this Programme, millions of Kenya’s children are dewormed yearly. The benefits of deworming have been proven through rigorous research that demonstrates that deworming increases participation of children in school by reducing absenteeism by up to 25% and improving their concentration in class. It is therefore complementary to the free primary education initiative. The NSBDP has completed its second year of implementation and the report is being released today. We celebrate its success in treating the 6.4 million children in over 15,000 schools in the 28 counties. The Ministry is particularly pleased that the deworming programme expanded to cover more areas than the first year. That North Eastern, Eastern and Central regions were also treated is indeed a significant success this year. This is particularly so due to the Ministry commitment to the goal of equity in service provision. We advised the programme not to exclude any deserving children in areas where research has demonstrated prevalence and intensity of worms that meet treatment thresholds. This was made possible through the generous financial support that the programme received from CIFF and the END Fund. We are grateful for this support, and we salute the programme for covering these areas. I want to thank the teachers in this country whose immense contribution to this programme ensured its success. As you may be aware, it is teachers who, after being trained, actually administer the medicines to the children. I also thank the other personnel from the two collaborating ministries, both from the national government and the counties.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XMJdlkPMdN0WEDnEaH1WwhBxWIho3zHsmY/XK3pCNek="},"c1ed0b18-cb9b-44ca-a240-8cd65023f41c":{"id_":"c1ed0b18-cb9b-44ca-a240-8cd65023f41c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"IR+kTvITyMyBRRKJ5WhVh2Y84G4Uj2yW6mzTG1LxNA0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cc80b876-d23d-4ec3-b392-44fd958a5d12","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"XMJdlkPMdN0WEDnEaH1WwhBxWIho3zHsmY/XK3pCNek="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"68b58b82-6d34-4976-8621-2bcd80c9a31c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"Y2TJgvMEEd21caL9Y5X/Y79tV49wN8mRPw4YEURMjYw="}},"text":"I acknowledge the efforts of the County Directors of Education and the staff of the School Health, Nutrition and Meals Unit have invested this programme, for which we are very grateful. May I also thank the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Health and his staff for enabling close collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The success we are celebrating today is testament to the effectiveness of the collaboration between the two ministries, the donor – Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, and technical partner Evidence Action. As was highlighted at the Paris meeting where both ministries were represented, this programme is a model which is being admired and emulated by other countries. The Ministry will maintain a high level of support for this programme. To ensure that this is achieved, this programme will be prioritized in our plans as provided for in the programme Implementation and Partnership Framework Agreement that all partners signed. In the next year, it will be on the Ministry’s workplan and it will be one of our performance indicators. The Ministry is working to enhance the management of programme data within the Education Management Information System. We support these efforts fully. We will endeavor to provide the resources, both human and material to ensure that the programme not only attains its objective, but that it is institutionalized within the Ministry’s structures and processes so as to be sustained for as long as children’s well-being is threatened by the presence of worms. The programme model’s flexibility and adaptability has seen it being applied to other programmes within government and in other countries. I call upon all partners to work together as we have worked in the last two years to sustain this success. The Ministry will surely continue to collaborate with all partners, and together we will determine the best ways and means of sustaining this programme beyond the donor commitment period. Mrs. Leah Rotich, Ag. Education Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\n\n# Message from Ministry of Health\n\nIt is in our performance contract that we will effectively provide deworming treatment to our children in schools. Health and education are the cornerstones of human capital and form the basis of an individual’s economic potential.

We seek to ensure that school children, other than achieving academic support, also receive health interventions that are critical at their tender ages in their schools. The Ministry of Health is delighted today to celebrate with partners, the successful completion of the second annual round of treatment and to release the results of the same. This year, the programme treated over 6.4 million children in over 15,000 schools in 28 counties, surpassing its target of 5.7 million children. This is an increase over the 6 million children that were treated last year. We recognize the efforts of all partners who contributed toward making this programme a success. We thank our counterparts from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology for a successful collaboration. The Ministry takes this programme very seriously and will continue to do so. For the last two years, deworming has remained one of the KPIs of the Ministry. It is in our performance contract that we will effectively provide deworming treatment to our children in schools. It will continue to be so. In Y2, the programme surpassed the Ministry’s internal target of 6 million children by over 400,000. This is quite an incredible performance. We are proud of this programme for, it not only improves the health of the children, but also educational outcomes. We know we are contributing to the development of human capital for our economic growth. If this is maintained, we are likely to have a more productive and industrialized healthy nation. We know it is a cost-effective programme. As a consequence of the programme model and the hard work put in by all, the Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Health Hon. James Macharia was invited to deliver the keynote address at a high level meeting of the STH community in Paris earlier this year. The CS led a Kenyan delegation, including a representative of the Permanent Secretary Education, to this meeting convened by Bill and Melinda Gates and Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, to share with the rest of the world on the programme’s best practices and how other governments can model their work along the Kenyan intervention. This successful meeting led to the donors committing more resources to support deworming initiatives in other countries. In the first and second years, the programme focused on launching and growing the programme to scale.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Y2TJgvMEEd21caL9Y5X/Y79tV49wN8mRPw4YEURMjYw="},"a2cbb052-773d-4e4f-98af-4921c23beca8":{"id_":"a2cbb052-773d-4e4f-98af-4921c23beca8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"IR+kTvITyMyBRRKJ5WhVh2Y84G4Uj2yW6mzTG1LxNA0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"68b58b82-6d34-4976-8621-2bcd80c9a31c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"Y2TJgvMEEd21caL9Y5X/Y79tV49wN8mRPw4YEURMjYw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d5e5fb69-7095-4a76-a226-a961e8ebc8a4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"EJVex3SIN0JWv48aWiuDY0wiw4QAlbLCfoAssg/4yoQ="}},"text":"In the first and second years, the programme focused on launching and growing the programme to scale. In the third year, the partners will focus on institutionalizing the programme to sustain the gains made so far and ensure continued treatment for all at-risk children; in fact this work has already begun. The Ministry of Health will work with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to explore ways in which the government can meet this objective. To this end, currently, the Ministry is working with WHO to streamline the procurement and distribution of deworming medicines. We are also in the process of integrating the school-based deworming data into the Health Management Information System, with the goal of improving data access and transparency for strategic decision making and linking of services. An important programme like this must be embedded in the structures of the Ministry in accordance with the School Health Policy. This year, with the support of the Programme we reinvigorated the School Health Technical Committee. We want all school health structures to be active, including the School Health Inter-agency Coordinating Committee. We will work to make them vibrant and engaged. We will also work with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the counties to review and update the School Health Policy in line with the devolved governance. All the relevant units of the Ministry will ensure a collaborative approach with the programme and our sister Ministry of MoEST. We appreciate our development partners with whom we have had and continue to forge harmonious relationships. The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the END Fund for extending financial support to the programme. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and Evidence Action who have contributed immensely to the Programme’s success by offering technical support. Their contributions cannot go unnoticed. Equally, we are indebted to the pharmaceutical companies for their kind donations which have been the backbone of the Programme. Without medicines, this programme would not have achieved the current levels of success. In the next three months, the Steering Committee will work with WHO to streamline drug procurement, distribution and management. We will eliminate delays, uncertainty and wastage. This is our priority. We are glad to work with Merck Serono and GlaxoSmithKline for making the drugs available through WHO.

Due to the negative impact of these worms on children’s health and education, the GoK launched the National School-Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP) in 2009, wherein 3.6 million children were dewormed. The programme’s goal is to eradicate parasitic worms as a public health problem in Kenya. It aims to treat at least 5 million Kenyan children each year for at least five years (2012-2016) in all primary schools in areas endemic for parasitic worms according to WHO criteria. Through the NSBDP, the GoK seeks to improve the health and education status of its children and secure Kenya’s future. Regularly providing deworming tablets to children through schools is a proven cost-effective treatment strategy due to the readily available, extensive and sustained educational infrastructure. WHO has certified the safety of administering deworming tablets by teachers, with support from the local health system. The NSBDP is implemented by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical assistance from Deworm the World Initiative (DtWI) at Evidence Action. Personnel from MoEST and MoH play a joint leadership role in ensuring that the programme is implemented in every public and private primary school within the targeted treatment areas with the aim of deworming every child aged 2-14 years, whether they are enrolled or not enrolled in school. While initiated and managed at the national level, the NSBDP is implemented within counties and sub-counties (formerly districts). Personnel from the MoEST and the MoH at the county and sub-county level play a joint leadership role in ensuring that the programme is implemented in every public and private primary school within targeted areas in their respective areas locations. Sub-county government officers from both ministries implement the programme in their sub-counties with supervision from their county leadership.

They are supported by their local health personnel, with oversight from sub-county and ward health and education personnel. Together, these teams of government officials from the counties, sub-counties and wards, including teachers, play an important role in benefiting the overall health and educational outcomes of Kenya’s children. # NSBDP targets at least 5 million primary school-age children who are at risk of parasitic worms\n\n# The Evidence Behind School-Based Deworming\n\nThe NSBDP is a national scale-up program based on rigorous evidence that has proven that deworming has a significant impact on children’s health and education. # The Problem: What are Worms? Worms, or minyoo in Swahili, are parasites that live in the human intestines and bladder. There are two types of worms treated by the NSBDP: soil-transmitted helminths (STH or common worms) and schistosomes (which cause bilharzia). Worm infection is a chronic condition that threatens children’s health and limits their access to education. Worms can cause anemia and malnutrition, impairing children’s mental and physical development. Children infected with worms can become too sick or tired to concentrate at school, or to even attend school at all. # The Solution: Why Deworming? Deworming children helps them grow and stay healthy and also improves their educational attainment. The benefits of deworming are immediate and positively impacts the children who receive treatment as well as their siblings and other children who live nearby. # Why School-Based Deworming? School-age children typically have the highest intensity of worm infestation of any age group. School-based deworming reaches children where they are – at school. Schools offer a readily available, extensive and sustained infrastructure that makes the programme cost-effective and operationally feasible. Additionally, schools are equipped with a skilled workforce that is in close contact with the community. # Evidence of Impact: How Does School-Based Deworming Benefit Children?

Due to spillover effects, deworming also dramatically improves cognition in untreated younger siblings that is equivalent to half a year of schooling. Additionally, adults who are dewormed as children earn wages over 20% higher than their untreated counterparts. # NSBDP Policy Framework\n\nThe NSBDP is embedded in several existing policies of the Government of Kenya. These policies ensure the programme is aligned with GoK priorities and infrastructure that ensure its sustainability. Two main policy documents that guide the implementation of NSBDP are the National school health policy and the National multi-year strategic plan for the control of NTDs. The National School Health Policy and its Guidelines, signed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health in 2009 prioritizes deworming under the thematic area on disease prevention and control. It defines school-based mass deworming as an effective preventive and treatment measure against parasitic worms. The policy states, “Treatment shall be administered to all school-age children, including those out of school, based on the prevalence and intensity of worms and bilharzia in the area. ” (pg. 32)\n\nThe National-Multi-Year Strategic Plan for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, 2011-2015 was launched in 2011. In this Strategic Plan, school-based deworming is identified as one of the treatment strategies for the control of worms and bilharzia. The NSBDP is one of the initiatives under the National School Health Programme at the Ministries of Health and Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, which is an integrated set of planned, school-based strategies, activities, and services to promote the health and educational development of pupils and the health of the community. ---\n# Implementing the National School-Based Deworming Programme\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme uses a cascade implementation model that efficiently and cost-effectively delivers training materials, deworming tablets, monitoring forms, funds, trainings other programme materials and resources from the National level to schools. At the National level, the Programme trains a team of MOEST and MOH officials as master trainers, requisitions deworming tablets through the MoH, and develops treatment and implementation strategies, training materials and monitoring tools.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YFTAnu9oEtHvMcC3406rCSbyJgdUEZQNQmflzsjcrJk="},"d581881b-5198-44a6-b64a-923417fd66aa":{"id_":"d581881b-5198-44a6-b64a-923417fd66aa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"IR+kTvITyMyBRRKJ5WhVh2Y84G4Uj2yW6mzTG1LxNA0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6da111d8-f1fb-4df9-b190-0bb0f1b7b5c9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"YFTAnu9oEtHvMcC3406rCSbyJgdUEZQNQmflzsjcrJk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"49965a00-ca7d-42eb-b21e-9dc984df7499","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"PVYtgvePGQY4X1dZzqmTJCRmCCJBTPxVG2uQLt/OQvs="}},"text":"Thereafter, an initial planning meeting is held with county and sub-county leadership. This meeting is followed by two levels of trainings on how to successfully implement the Deworming Programme: Sub-county level training and Teacher Trainings. These trainings prepare sub-county and ward officials to plan other lower level programme activities within the cascade, distribution of materials, planning of deworming and community mobilization and sensitization. After these trainings and community mobilization, the critical day of implementation occurs – Deworming Day – where teachers administer deworming tablets to millions of children in over 11,000 schools across Kenya and fill in monitoring forms to capture treatment data. These forms and any unused deworming tablets are moved up through a “Reverse Cascade” as described below. The cascade model helps to manage the national scale of the NSBDP, and therefore, builds capacity for successful implementation at various levels. Additionally, the cascade brings together MoEST and MoH personnel through collaborative leadership responsibilities for the planning, implementation and monitoring of programme activities at all levels. The cascade is outlined in the infographic below. # 1 County Planning and Sensitization Meetings\n\nAfter deworming, monitoring forms are returned to the National Office and unused drugs are distributed to health facilities within the County. Before implementation takes place within each county, the County Director of Education (CDE) and the County Director of Health (CDH) convene a County Meeting, facilitated by the National Programme team, where county and sub-county-level personnel are sensitized about the Programme and made aware of their managerial roles. This is a critical meeting, as the programme gains buy-in and builds partnerships by engaging with the newly created county-level structure in Kenya. County-level responsibilities include: providing planning & supportive supervision to sub-counties, monitoring Teacher Training Sessions and Deworming Day, performing county-level community sensitization, and responding to questions regarding the programme from other partners and the media. Key participants of this meeting include Sub-County Directors of Education (SDEs) and Sub-County Medical Officers of Health (SMOHs), who play critical leadership roles in implementing the Programme. # 2 Sub-County Training\n\nMaster Trainers are deployed to train Sub-County and Ward personnel from both Ministries on managing and implementing the programme at that level including training of teachers on how to implement a successful Deworming Day.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rbe0XgYGvh+jhAkt9SRnWi+uEuo/4TWZX/nY3r6kBdw="},"49965a00-ca7d-42eb-b21e-9dc984df7499":{"id_":"49965a00-ca7d-42eb-b21e-9dc984df7499","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"IR+kTvITyMyBRRKJ5WhVh2Y84G4Uj2yW6mzTG1LxNA0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d581881b-5198-44a6-b64a-923417fd66aa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"rbe0XgYGvh+jhAkt9SRnWi+uEuo/4TWZX/nY3r6kBdw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d8c21a28-952d-4eef-9357-32f8bae1b220","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 2 Treatment Results Booklet_2014.pdf"},"hash":"URnE+pUL8BPVwGlWMz/9azAS0yb4QeoHBDqLSus/bs4="}},"text":"During the training, SMOHs and SDEs work together to finalize the list of schools to be dewormed and determine the quantity of deworming tablets needed for each school based on enrollment figures.

SDEs are also responsible for receiving and distributing all training materials and ensuring schools’ attendance at Teacher Trainings, while SMOHs are responsible for picking up deworming tablets from the regional depot, managing their distribution to each school during Teacher Training sessions, overseeing community-level sensitization activities; managing any SAEs and ensuring that tablets remaining after Deworming Day are taken to health facilities. # 3 Teacher Training\n\nTrained ward-level personnel train primary school Head and Health teachers, with oversight from sub-county officials, on their key roles for implementing a successful Deworming Day (DD). These include: sensitizing the community and preparing for treatment before DD, administering deworming tablets, filling monitoring forms during DD, and returning forms through the reverse cascade, and returning remaining deworming tablets to MoH after DD. Immediately after Teacher Trainings, community-level health workers, alongside teachers, share the community sensitization messages with community members, including children, parents, village elders, and community-based organizations prior to treatment so as to encourage community members to participate, particularly non-enrolled children. # 4 Deworming Day\n\nOn a designated County Deworming Day, teachers administer deworming tablets to children in schools within programme coverage areas and fill in monitoring forms to record the number of children dewormed.

Additionally, KEMRI conducted mapping and related parasitological analyses in Eastern, Central and North Eastern regions to provide evidence for expansion of the programme to areas at risk of schistosomiasis. This has informed additional treatments in these regions in this second year of the programme. In 2012, KEMRI conducted a baseline survey for monitoring and evaluation in the sub-counties in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Coastal regions in order to capture specific data on worm infection prevalence before treatment. This data would be later used to analyze the effect of deworming after each round of treatment. In the following years, KEMRI will continue to conduct annual pre- and post- treatment evaluations to analyze the impact of deworming over time.

END Fund does this by: 1) mobilizing and directing resources to where they can have maximum impact, 2) advocating for innovative, integrated, and cost-effective NTD programs; and 3) facilitating private sector engagement in the movement to address the devastating effects of NTDs. In line with this strategy, one of the END Fund’s core competencies and activities is the ongoing mapping and assessment of the NTD landscape of partners, projects, national plans, program implementing organizations, and Ministry of Health capacity across disease-endemic countries. END Fund proactively assesses where resource investment can most efficiently and effectively move forward the NTD control and elimination agenda. END Fund then makes strategic investment recommendations to donors engaging in the cause. Where no existing qualified program implementing partner exists, the END Fund at times implements direct NTD programs in partnership with Ministries of Health.

The ministry is keen on ensuring the fulfilment of the Dakar Framework on Education for All that aims to provide all children with education as a basic human right. The Ministry has put in place robust policies in the education sector to help it achieve its goals. Among these policies is the National School Health Policy and its guidelines, implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. This policy defines a holistic approach to improve children’s health in order to achieve improvements in access, retention, inclusion and equity in education. The policy is intended to achieve sustainable development as part of a wider strategy towards the achievement of Kenya’s Vision 2030, the National Education Sector Programme, and is aligned with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The ministries of education and health are working together to review this policy and redefine school health programmes in the country for the next five years. # The National School-Based Deworming Programme\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme plays a major role in ensuring the health of children as an important contribution to their educational outcomes. The programme has treated children annually since 2012 against parasitic worms that cause ill health and interfere with school attendance. Evidence shows that deworming improves children’s educational outcomes by reducing absenteeism where healthier children concentrate better in class, and consequently, is synergistic to Kenya’s free primary education initiative. The programme has succeeded in reaching its targets and reducing worm infection among children, and serves as a global model of school-based deworming. The programme was able to treat 6.17 million children in over 15,000 schools in its third year. The collaboration between the ministries of education and health has demonstrated the benefits our country can reap by strengthening inter-ministerial approaches to interventions that change lives in our schools and communities. We will endeavor to provide all the required resources, to ensure that the programme not only meets its objectives, but that it is institutionalized within the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JTKjNZ/CvTDhimKmhgyW/Yz1AojIo2MqEY6RK3N/uMI="},"05753350-d0de-483a-8371-aaf0ff11faec":{"id_":"05753350-d0de-483a-8371-aaf0ff11faec","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"13896a95-0c61-4902-a018-a452b27cbf6b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"JTKjNZ/CvTDhimKmhgyW/Yz1AojIo2MqEY6RK3N/uMI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0e9b44cb-29b6-4c5d-a378-841a8c1c0fd0","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"Sm4htWc+xBW+Aggs6R36ugk/4Hq26pCxJ5c/8wkESyU="}},"text":"Now in its fourth year of implementation, there is a need to sustain the existing gains beyond the current programme’s term, and ensure that the goal of eliminating worms as a public health problem in Kenya is achieved.

In its third year, the programme dewormed 6.17 million children for soil-transmitted helminths in over 15,000 primary schools, reaching 85% of targeted children. The sustained high treatment coverage of this programme over three years has successfully reduced the prevalence of soil transmitted helminths (STH) in Kenya from 33% in 2012 to 6% in 2015. The successes of school-based deworming in Kenya serve as useful best practices and lessons that other countries draw upon to implement their own national school-based deworming programmes. This is demonstrated by the implementation support the Kenya programme is providing to other countries in Africa - in Ethiopia, for example, I am aware that millions of children receive treatment due to collective efforts including collaborations with the Kenya programme. The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, is currently focused on sustaining the programme to ensure that school-based deworming remains a priority in Kenya as long as worms remain a public health problem in the country. The Ministry of Health staff have been instrumental in the success of the programme and the ministry will continue to deploy staff as needed to support this programme. The Ministry of Health will continue working with that of Education Science and Technology to implement an integrated school health programme which will complement the deworming programme efforts by improving sanitation and promoting healthier behaviors among children in schools.

All children aged 2-14 years in at-risk sub-counties, whether enrolled or not enrolled in school, are targeted for treatment at primary schools. The deworming programme has operated successfully since 2009, wherein 3.6 million children were dewormed. Following the success of the first round of implementation, the programme was expanded to a national programme in 2011 and has since dewormed 5.9 million, 6.4 million and 6.17 million children in 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 respectively. Treatment takes place in schools across at-risk areas endemic for parasitic worms. Selection of these areas is determined according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Regularly providing deworming tablets to children through schools is a proven cost-effective and safe treatment strategy due to the readily available, extensive and sustained educational infrastructure. The World Health Organization has certified the safety of administering deworming tablets by teachers, with support from the local health system. While initiated and managed at the national level, the National School-Based Deworming Programme is implemented at the county level where Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health officials play a joint leadership role in ensuring that all children at risk of parasitic worms are treated at schools. The programme is embedded in existing policies of the Government of Kenya that guides its alignment with national priorities. These policies include the National School Health Policy and Guidelines (2009), which prioritizes deworming under the thematic area on disease prevention and control; and the National-Multi-Year Strategic Plan for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2011-2015), which identifies school-based deworming as one of the treatment strategies for the control of soil transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis. These policy documents are currently under review and will inform future school based deworming activities. Along with these policies, the programme is also a model programme under the National School Health Programme which illustrates impact of inter-ministerial collaboration at the health and education dockets, in order to promote the health and educational development of school going children and their communities.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nwyFUrU92PX4mINsFnfT8qKInpl6ZoAHwn5LokJb6ZA="},"768676b7-1a2f-4203-8193-848e380530a7":{"id_":"768676b7-1a2f-4203-8193-848e380530a7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b35ea9fd-c0be-477d-bf42-67084d8eb4d3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"nwyFUrU92PX4mINsFnfT8qKInpl6ZoAHwn5LokJb6ZA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cc2f7041-1dfa-408f-a91e-5a24bd5f66a6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"8wBNYWxBRMalZ9FY+WsZPIObOgLeDTYYQMsmnXidblM="}},"text":"The programme is implemented with technical and coordination support from Evidence Action, a non-governmental organization that advocates for school-based deworming among policymakers and provides technical assistance to launch, strengthen and sustain school-based deworming programmes globally. # Financial support for the programme\n\nFinancial support for the programme has been provided by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and The END Fund. The deworming medicines are part of WHO’s international drug donation programme that provides deworming medicines for school-age children free to the Ministry of Health through GlaxoSmithKline (albendazole) and Merck (praziquantel). # Critical success factors of the National School-Based Deworming Programme\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme is a unified national programme coordinated at national level with coordinated and collaborative participation of ministries of health and education and their partners. This catalytic partnership has resulted in a strong programme partnership agreement involving MOEST, MOH, CIFF, END Fund, WHO, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Evidence Action. These partners have facilitated and overseen three consecutive annual mass deworming rounds that target all at-risk school-age and pre-school-age children. The evidence-based programme’s design is informed by results from continuous process monitoring, treatment data management, and annual prevalence and intensity surveys conducted pre- and post-deworming to understand changes in infection patterns. Targeting children through schools effectively reaches over 80% of the target population in all at risk geographies in the country. Through the school-based programme, trained and trusted primary school teachers administer deworming medicines to children from an early age of 2 years; the programme leverages the existing and extensive infrastructure of schools where children are easily accessed and managed. Deworming medicines are safe, available and easy to administer by trained teachers. Children who are not enrolled in school are encouraged to participate in the deworming exercise through various community mobilization channels including interpersonal communication, mass media and information, education, communication materials targeting parents, teachers and children.

Worms, or minyoo in Swahili, are parasites that live in the human intestines and bladder for survival. There are two types of worms treated by the Kenya school based deworming programme: soil-transmitted helminths (STH, or common worms) and schistosomes (which cause schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia). Worm infection is a chronic condition that can cause anemia and malnutrition, impairing children’s mental and physical development and posing a serious threat to their health, education, and productivity. Children infected with worms can become too sick or tired to concentrate at school, or to even attend school at all. Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# THE SOLUTION\n\n# Why Deworming? Deworming children helps them grow and stay healthy and also improves their educational attainment. The benefits of deworming are immediate and it positively impacts the children who receive treatment as well as their siblings and other children who live nearby. # Why School-Based Deworming? School-age children typically have the highest intensity of worm infection of any age group. School-based deworming reaches children where they are – at school. Schools offer a readily available, extensive and sustained infrastructure that makes the programme cost-effective and operationally feasible. # THE IMPACT\n\n# How Does School-Based Deworming Benefit Children?","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LTYcbpS0q3id9QTfN8jQDQ8Cjl59TDA9mFwImvWsvBk="},"dd87a480-b9d7-42ff-8678-f710ec1af6f4":{"id_":"dd87a480-b9d7-42ff-8678-f710ec1af6f4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"942d114d-0efe-4ccb-b883-88a00c4d3566","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"LTYcbpS0q3id9QTfN8jQDQ8Cjl59TDA9mFwImvWsvBk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e2d20e08-c125-4426-882c-121d3c483d8a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"d9xK6IgrcXj+97Udgs/jV/geXjSzVRGoXd7BmG4cxII="}},"text":"# THE IMPACT\n\n# How Does School-Based Deworming Benefit Children? Results from rigorous, long-term studies conducted in Kenya evaluating school-based deworming demonstrate the long-lasting benefits of deworming on school participation, future earnings, and cognition. Some key findings include:\n\n- Experimental evaluation in Western Kenya found a 25% reduction in student absenteeism at treatment schools. (Miguel and Kremmer, 2004)\n- A long-run study based on the Western Kenya deworming finds that among females, deworming increased the rate of passing the national primary school exit exam by 9.5 percentage points (Baird and colleagues, 2011)\n- In Kenya, adult men who were treated as children worked 3.4 more hours per week, spent more time in entrepreneurial activities, and were more likely to work in higher-wage manufacturing jobs. This long-term impact study in Kenya calculates a rate of return for governments who invest in deworming of 32-52%. - A study suggests that reduced exposure to worm infections may improve cognition for children less than one year of age. The young children in the catchment area of treatment schools showed large gains on cognitive tests approximately ten years later. (Ozier, 2015)\n\nFor more evidence on the impact of deworming, please visit http://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld\n\n# Sustaining Deworming’s Impact in Kenya\n\nIn order to achieve the goal of eliminating parasitic worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya, the current successes and impact of the National School-Based Deworming Programme need to be sustained beyond the current five-year implementation period (2012-2017). Sustainability can be achieved through the institutionalization of programme components within existing governmental structures - organized, resourced, and coordinated at the national level and implemented locally by the counties. # What is the vision for a sustained deworming programme in Kenya? By 2022, Kenya’s National School-Based Deworming Programme continues to run in an effective, evidence-informed manner, and is largely financed and implemented by the Government of Kenya at the national level. The well-designed implementation cascade will be maintained as it is simple, upholds cost-effectiveness, scalable, replicable and manageable. - Funding: the government finances and resources up to 80% of the programme through the existing government structures, with complementary support from the private sector and the donor community.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uc2pRi53V4fctXNWEdlQ6c+jc5qeS3PmlcOaBj9aoOs="},"e2d20e08-c125-4426-882c-121d3c483d8a":{"id_":"e2d20e08-c125-4426-882c-121d3c483d8a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dd87a480-b9d7-42ff-8678-f710ec1af6f4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"uc2pRi53V4fctXNWEdlQ6c+jc5qeS3PmlcOaBj9aoOs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"960d33b6-d170-44de-8a8e-f437fe054560","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"btQfL8d5L59/W7LCp7J062MoG20ZcGHKp0jwcp2h/KM="}},"text":"- Implementation: A programme management unit is established within the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to ensure that the programme is planned and coordinated at national level for better linkages and economies of scale, with the Ministry of Health coordinating the sourcing and distribution of deworming tablets. - Impact: As a result of the collaborative partnership between the two ministries, the tablets and materials are cascaded down to schools efficiently, and the programme continues to treat all at-risk school-age children through schools. In addition, by providing impact data and information on the programme, the public is sensitized on the importance of deworming, resulting in a strong demand for deworming by local communities; local, county, and national leaders; and the private sector.

This will ensure each programme component contributes to the vision of Kenya eliminating worms as a public health problem to its children. Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# Implementing the Deworming\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme uses a cascade implementation model that efficiently and cost-effectively delivers deworming medicines from the national level to schools. The cascade brings together personnel from the ministries of education and health through collaboration. At the national level, government officials train teams of “Master Trainers” drawn from the two ministries at the county-level. The programme ensures these medicines reach schools in good time. Further, implementation strategies, training materials and monitoring tools are developed. # County Planning and Sensitization Meeting\n\nBefore implementation takes place within each county, the County Director of Education and the County Director of Health convene a meeting, facilitated by the national programme team, where county and sub-county-level personnel are sensitized on the programme and their managerial roles during implementation. This is a critical meeting, as the programme gains buy-in and builds partnerships by engaging with the recently created county-level structures in Kenya. County level responsibilities include coordination of county-based master trainers, management of deworming tablets and programme materials, planning and reviewing cascade activities at the county level and financial management. Further, the county directors serve as the programme’s spokespersons at the county.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"d9xK6IgrcXj+97Udgs/jV/geXjSzVRGoXd7BmG4cxII="},"960d33b6-d170-44de-8a8e-f437fe054560":{"id_":"960d33b6-d170-44de-8a8e-f437fe054560","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e2d20e08-c125-4426-882c-121d3c483d8a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"d9xK6IgrcXj+97Udgs/jV/geXjSzVRGoXd7BmG4cxII="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2017749a-04e3-4a15-b4d6-192146b43ff0","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"J6HOds21PpCi0XtH35OMcUfapjkB1IW/sBX0PKqlX7I="}},"text":"Further, the county directors serve as the programme’s spokespersons at the county. # Sub-County Training\n\nCounty-based Master Trainers are deployed to train sub-county and division level personnel on managing and implementing the programme, including training teachers on how to implement a successful Deworming Day.

Immediately after Teacher Trainings, the community sensitization and mobilization timeframe officially begins where community-level health workers, alongside teachers share key messages with community members, including children, parents, village elders, and community-based organizations prior to treatment. The aim is to encourage community members to bring their children for deworming, particularly non-enrolled children. Posters sharing messages on a) the importance of deworming, b) ways to prevent worm infections, and c) the date and location of Deworming Day are also posted in strategic places around the community by teachers and community health workers. # Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# Programme: The Cascade\n\nivers training materials, deworming tablets, monitoring forms, funds, trainings and other programme materials and resources from active leadership responsibilities for the planning, implementation and monitoring of programme activities at all levels.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"btQfL8d5L59/W7LCp7J062MoG20ZcGHKp0jwcp2h/KM="},"2017749a-04e3-4a15-b4d6-192146b43ff0":{"id_":"2017749a-04e3-4a15-b4d6-192146b43ff0","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"960d33b6-d170-44de-8a8e-f437fe054560","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"btQfL8d5L59/W7LCp7J062MoG20ZcGHKp0jwcp2h/KM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"22b6d557-30f6-4a40-b5d1-7d38d61347ed","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"HDSW9XToLJWiHop/tfAeiaDW18t0LW5K4vqFc4sm6xM="}},"text":"ogramme governance structures are responsible for ensuring medicines are available each year for deworming in schools and that developed at the national level and cascaded down as described below:\n\n# Deworming Day\n\nOn a designated county Deworming Day, teachers administer deworming tablets to children in schools within programme coverage areas. Tablets for treatment of soil transmitted helminthes are given to all children aged 2-14 years whilst treatment for schistosomiasis is administered to all children aged 6 to 14 years. Children targeted include those enrolled in primary schools, in nearby Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centers, and those from the surrounding community who are not enrolled in school. Teachers also fill in monitoring forms to record the number of children dewormed. Ministry of Health personnel visit schools to monitor treatment to ensure proper administration and manage any occurring serious adverse events should they arise. Personnel from the Ministry of Education Science and Technology are also available to provide supportive supervision to teachers during Deworming Day. # Reverse Cascade\n\nAfter Deworming Day, schools send their filled in monitoring forms to their division-level Area Education Officer (AEO), who then compiles division-level data and sends it to the SCDE for sub-county-level summarization. The SCDE shares the data with the SCMOH and County personnel and returns the forms, along with financial accountability documentation to the National Secretariat for data analysis and financial management. Any remaining deworming tablets at the schools are collected by the AEOs and then given to the division-level Public Health Officers who then fill a tablet tracking form. This shows the number of unused tablets and distribution channel to the local health facilities for use in community deworming (after approval by the SCMOH). The tracking form is shared with the SCDE and County personnel, and returned, along with financial accountability documentation, to the National Secretariat for data analysis, donor reporting and financial management. Ultimately, the Reverse Cascade process is critical for the calculation of the number of children treated, the quantities of tablets used and redistributed to the community, and ultimately, the success of the programme. Integration of the NSBDP data into the Ministry of Health’s Management Information System (DHIS-2) is ongoing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J6HOds21PpCi0XtH35OMcUfapjkB1IW/sBX0PKqlX7I="},"22b6d557-30f6-4a40-b5d1-7d38d61347ed":{"id_":"22b6d557-30f6-4a40-b5d1-7d38d61347ed","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2017749a-04e3-4a15-b4d6-192146b43ff0","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"J6HOds21PpCi0XtH35OMcUfapjkB1IW/sBX0PKqlX7I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5d7a78c0-69bf-4d2f-9e79-a8b0e69f565d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"nFEApAyNVefYnWa1qFybzFC7E/qCGactry66NSRwEdU="}},"text":"Majority of sub-county level Health Records and Information Officers have entered 2014-2015 school-based deworming data (for treatment of soil transmitted helminthes only) into DHIS-2.

Its internationally-renowned experts in STH and Schistosomiasis mapping provide technical epidemiological and parasitology support towards the programme’s monitoring and evaluation activities. Further, the parasitology evidence generated by KEMRI is fundamental for decisions on programme treatment targeting. # Programme Targeting\n\nScientists from KEMRI help define the programme’s targeted geographies. In 2009, they defined the initial target geographies when they determined that the prevalence and intensity of worm infection in sub-counties in Western, Nyanza, Coast and parts of Rift Valley regions justified treating every child in identified areas through a mass drug administration campaign. Each year, further parasitological analysis has informed programme expansion, including:\n\n- In 2012-2013, parts of Central region were added to the programme’s Schistosomiasis-treating regions. - In 2013-2014, the programme added areas in Eastern, Central and North Eastern regions for Schistosomiasis treatment based on school-based questionnaires assessing whether children had indicated blood in urine (BIU), and parasitology surveys. - In 2014-2015, KEMRI conducted parasitology mapping in North Eastern region to confirm BIU findings from this region. As a result of new evidence that did not support the BIU data, the programme refined its treatment targets in North Eastern, reducing the number of targeted counties and schools. # Programme Impact\n\nEach year, KEMRI conducts school-level surveys capturing worm prevalence and intensity for all three types of STH (hookworm, whipworm, and roundworm) and Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium in school-age children. These surveys, which analyze the impact of deworming over time, take place before and after deworming in a randomized selection of 60 schools drawn from 20 sub-counties distributed across 16 Counties in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Coast regions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yTWVhjGNCk7HY9vKmaaxZZQ/n5fAwaw/+kSw0jqNWDA="},"68726c21-9f67-48e0-999e-786389594fd4":{"id_":"68726c21-9f67-48e0-999e-786389594fd4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"+iTSkQYtdEBD2aH7k713ylrMYA6RhJsOKUiHiGAsyQs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1a526d6b-a74f-48a8-9702-8332ac1397ca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"yTWVhjGNCk7HY9vKmaaxZZQ/n5fAwaw/+kSw0jqNWDA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5904f457-b53d-45b0-bafb-96f65d6416e9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 3 Treatment Results Booklet_2015.pdf"},"hash":"vdptxHvjUEPaqd7VoRd+a4DznRNMPru1X9kTKQ2+Bm8="}},"text":"In addition, 200 schools were surveyed in Y1 baseline and Y3 mid-term, to monitor long-term changes in worm infection at national level; this category will also be surveyed in Y5 end-term.

In order to realize this vision, all Ministry programmes are anchored on international, regional and national commitments. These commitments have been factored in the Ministry’s legal, policy and strategy documents. The achievement of Education for All (EFA) goals is a key priority in the National Education Sector Plan (NESP) 2013-2018. The NESP recognises that improved health and nutrition increases enrolment and stabilises attendance. The Ministry of Education works alongside other stakeholders under the umbrella of the National School Health Policy 2009 (currently under review) to roll out a comprehensive school health programme that develops and strengthens inter-sectoral partnerships between health, education, the community, children, and other stakeholders. The comprehensive school health programme provides and/or supports the provision of targeted school-based health services to school-aged children at risk. School-based deworming, being one such initiative, has been carried out successfully over the past four years. Last year it reached over 16,000 primary schools across the country, in two waves. This success is, without question, due to the unique collaboration between the Ministries of Education and Health. The Ministry of Education is proud to celebrate the deworming of over 6.4 million children in the fourth annual round of deworming which is in turn a fulfilment of the performance contract of the ministry. The successes of the programme have been unmatched and it is no surprise that the country is seen as a model for other countries to learn from. Having a programme exceed its targets year after year can only be attributed to effective partnerships with dedicated stakeholders. I want to thank the teachers in this country whose immense contribution to this programme ensured its success. It is teachers who are trained to take this programme to its last mile. I also thank the other personnel from the two collaborating ministries, both from the national government and the counties. I acknowledge the efforts of the County Directors of Education and the staff of the School Health, Nutrition and Meals Unit, who have invested in this programme.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HFhWRd5G4Avf+0QwgFY23ad/LT0nQNPP1iQPIfDyhRM="},"c87cd7fa-a87d-40a2-a267-b7aba32a176a":{"id_":"c87cd7fa-a87d-40a2-a267-b7aba32a176a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d616c5aa-d079-4f44-b982-03563215a270","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"HFhWRd5G4Avf+0QwgFY23ad/LT0nQNPP1iQPIfDyhRM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ccc1f17b-47e3-4f26-8454-268922c6d4be","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"T65Nx6o4NFwymKj1A8gfHM5a0SJLSvZmiJIkGb/Ln0o="}},"text":"May I also thank the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Health and his staff for enabling close collaboration with the Ministry of Education.

Dr. Belio Kipsang, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Education\n---\n# Message from the Ministry of Health\n\nThe physical health of a citizenry has a direct effect on the social and economic indicators of a nation. In Kenya, as elsewhere, health and education are the main pillars in society that determine the potential of individuals to contribute significantly to the economy. School-aged children make up about 42% of our total population and ill health is an impediment to their achieving their full potential. The importance of this programme to the Ministry cannot be overstated. For the last four years, deworming has been prioritized as one of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the Ministry. It is in our performance contract that we will effectively provide deworming treatment to our children in schools. We take pride that this cost-effective programme not only improves children’s health but also educational outcomes. We know we are contributing to the development of human capital for our economic growth. The Ministry of Health is delighted today to celebrate with partners the successful completion of the fourth annual round of treatment and to release the results of the same. This year, the programme treated over 6.4 million children in over 16,000 schools in 27 counties, surpassing its target of 5.7 million children. This is an increase over the 6.2 million children that were treated last year. We recognize the efforts all partners who contributed toward making this programme a success. We are grateful for the unique relationship that we have with the Ministry of Education. The focus over the last year has been institutionalisation of the programme and we have made significant progress. The programme, being of great importance, must continue to be embedded in the structures of the Ministries under the integrated school health programme.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qxf8rTha7EUqQQvwh93n5YVmyTA/lMxW0/Y2Gq/zaZo="},"ccc1f17b-47e3-4f26-8454-268922c6d4be":{"id_":"ccc1f17b-47e3-4f26-8454-268922c6d4be","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c87cd7fa-a87d-40a2-a267-b7aba32a176a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"qxf8rTha7EUqQQvwh93n5YVmyTA/lMxW0/Y2Gq/zaZo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2ace3f93-2c0e-4812-a3bf-54375d68a638","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"Cqqh4qTOwm6XUVjHOnYEMO997IOy4lWD8riVPDt+6i0="}},"text":"We continue to offer our unequivocal appreciation to the pharmaceutical companies, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline, who have over the years donated drugs through the World Health Organisation (WHO) that are the backbone of the programme.

The goal of the programme is to remove parasitic worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya. The programme’s aim is to treat at least 5.5 million Kenyan children each year for five years (2012-2017). It targets all children aged 2-14 years in at-risk sub-counties, regardless of primary school enrolment. In Kenya, more than 5 million school-age children are at risk of intestinal parasitic worms, including soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomes, which have a negative impact on their health and education. The Government of Kenya recognizes that the health and education of its children are key in building a bright future. As such, it has made deworming a national priority through the National School-Based Deworming Programme. The deworming programme has operated successfully since 2009, when 3.6 million children were dewormed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Cqqh4qTOwm6XUVjHOnYEMO997IOy4lWD8riVPDt+6i0="},"d6891948-245b-4a5d-b7f8-df8d64e8c2b5":{"id_":"d6891948-245b-4a5d-b7f8-df8d64e8c2b5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2ace3f93-2c0e-4812-a3bf-54375d68a638","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"Cqqh4qTOwm6XUVjHOnYEMO997IOy4lWD8riVPDt+6i0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5015da5b-4279-4856-b2d1-06e4bf47b49d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"EyErCim/+5iw6VRsLHQ3VtRxtOQQtA7lX/RkJ1eIE/U="}},"text":"Following the success of the first round of implementation, the programme was expanded to a national programme in 2011 and has since dewormed 5.9 million, 6.4 million, 6.17 million and 6.4 million children in 2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, respectively. Treatment takes place in schools across at-risk areas endemic for parasitic worms. Selection of these areas is determined according to World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Regularly providing deworming tablets to children through schools is a proven, cost-effective and safe treatment strategy due to the readily available, extensive and sustained educational infrastructure. WHO has certified the safety of administration of deworming tablets by teachers with support from the local health system. While initiated and managed at the national level, the National School-Based Deworming Programme is implemented at the county level. Personnel from the two ministries play a joint leadership role in ensuring that the programme is implemented in every school within the targeted treatment areas. More details of the implementation model can be found on pages 11-13. The programme is embedded in several existing policies of the Government of Kenya that guide its alignment with national priorities and infrastructure that promotes its sustainability. These include:\n\n- National School Health Policy and Guidelines (2009) (currently under review), which prioritizes deworming under the thematic area of disease prevention and control\n- The 2nd Kenya National Strategic Plan For Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2016-2020), which identifies school-based deworming as one of the treatment strategies for the control of worms and bilharzia. Along with these policies, the programme is also an initiative under the National School Health Programme at the Ministries of Health and Education, which is aimed at promoting the health and educational development of pupils and the health of the community. The programme is implemented with technical and administrative support from the Deworm the World Initiative at Evidence Action which advocates for school-based deworming and provides technical assistance to launch, strengthen and sustain school-based deworming programmes. The organisation works directly with governments to rapidly scale deworming programs targeting all at-risk school-age children.

The deworming medicines are part of WHO’s international medicine donation programme. These medicines (albendazole and praziquantel) are provided free of charge to the Ministry of Health through GlaxoSmithKline and Merck respectively. ---\n# Critical factors for the success of National School-Based Deworming Programme\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme is a unified national programme, coordinated at national level with collaborative participation of Ministries of Health and Education and their partners. This catalytic partnership has resulted in a strong programme partnership agreement involving MOE, MOH, CIFF, END Fund, WHO, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and Evidence Action. These partners have facilitated and overseen four consecutive annual mass deworming rounds that target all at-risk school-age and preschool-age children. The evidence-based programme design is informed by results from continuous process monitoring, treatment data management, and annual prevalence and intensity surveys conducted pre- and post-deworming to understand changes in infection patterns. Targeting children through schools effectively reaches over 80% of the target population in all at-risk geographies in the country. Through the school-based programme, trained and trusted primary school teachers administer deworming medicines to children from as young as 2 years. The programme leverages the existing and extensive infrastructure of schools where children are easily accessed and managed. Deworming medicines are safe, available and easy to administer by trained teachers. Children who are not enrolled in school are encouraged to participate in the deworming exercise through various community mobilization channels including interpersonal communication, mass media and information, education, and communication materials targeting parents, teachers and children. The government of Kenya leads and owns the programme through the programme governance structures and the contribution of significant in-kind resources through the provision of education and health staff at all levels. # Challenges faced in implementation of the programme\n\nThough the programme is a success overall, implementation is not without challenges. Different counties have varying governing systems making timing of activities difficult. The ideal would be a national deworming day across all treatment areas, but this is not possible because of competing priorities and programmes within counties. The overarching goal of the programme is to eliminate worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EyErCim/+5iw6VRsLHQ3VtRxtOQQtA7lX/RkJ1eIE/U="},"0c4ff1b6-42cd-4916-b53b-fc673728eae5":{"id_":"0c4ff1b6-42cd-4916-b53b-fc673728eae5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5015da5b-4279-4856-b2d1-06e4bf47b49d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"EyErCim/+5iw6VRsLHQ3VtRxtOQQtA7lX/RkJ1eIE/U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d5658c9a-c387-4013-aa14-7f22a8006fe8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"0DsZs7rrEwQKiO4FXy8v+3hF05CKk8Qrj/exl+1zQLE="}},"text":"The overarching goal of the programme is to eliminate worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya. However, even with annual treatment covering over 80% of the target population, there is still the problem of recrudescence as seen from KEMRI’s prevalence surveys. There is need for other interventions to come into play such as Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes to permanently lower worm prevalence. The programme has run for four consecutive years and it is, in every sense, a government programme. Evidence Action has provided technical assistance, process monitoring and coverage validation, and fiscal management and administrative support, and has worked towards ensuring that the lowest possible cost is incurred to deworm each child. With the programme coming to the end of its first five-year cycle in mid-2017, conversations are underway about the programme’s future structure, governance, and financial sustainability. The government is keen to have the programme continue for at least another five years. ---\n# Kenya National School Based Deworming Programme\n\n# Working Towards the Elimination of Worms in Kenya: The TUMIKIA and TakeUp Projects\n\nBuilding on the success of the National School-Based Deworming Programme, the Government of Kenya is keen to reach other members of the community also infected with worms and wants to learn whether combining school- and community-based deworming is a more effective method of controlling and ultimately eliminating intestinal worms in Kenya compared to school-based deworming alone. This hypothesis is being tested through the TUMIKIA Project (Tuangamize Minyoo Kenya Imarisha Afya, which from Swahili loosely translates to “Let us eradicate worms in Kenya to improve health”). This is a trial conducted by KEMRI in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The two-year trial is being conducted in coastal and western Kenya, leveraging the NSBDP to strengthen the evidence base surrounding STH control and elimination. It is scheduled to be completed in mid-2017. To learn more about the TUMIKIA Project, please visit thiswormyworld.org/tumikia-project. Evidence Action, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, is testing the feasibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of stimulating the take-up of deworming treatment using social and behavioral incentives among adult community members.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yjIPr5K6nZlSwFpOJbNyvHA/2ZAxktXi4ULMnEQ4qdo="},"d5658c9a-c387-4013-aa14-7f22a8006fe8":{"id_":"d5658c9a-c387-4013-aa14-7f22a8006fe8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0c4ff1b6-42cd-4916-b53b-fc673728eae5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"yjIPr5K6nZlSwFpOJbNyvHA/2ZAxktXi4ULMnEQ4qdo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"898dc5e5-a5aa-4835-97c9-da8136584997","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"v3R6s211ba77zgJu+vujV/+GmEMVBKwfltSIS8XUX1A="}},"text":"The study, called TakeUp, is a randomized controlled trial and has been implemented in three counties of western Kenya. Analysis is underway and the forthcoming results will provide insights around the potential utility of social incentives in maximizing treatment coverage throughout communities. # Extending Deworming Beyond Kenya\n\nWith the sustained registered successes of the National School-Based Deworming Programme, the Deworm the World Initiative has worked to extend deworming beyond Kenya and applied lessons learned to additional countries in need. Deworm the World was able to facilitate collaboration as well as apply best practices and lessons learned from Kenya to a program run by the Government of Ethiopia. Government officials from the Federal Ministries of Health and Education as well as members of the Ethiopian Public Health Institute visited the Government of Kenya (the Ministries of Health and Education and KEMRI) to learn more about Kenya’s practices in the areas of policy development, budgeting, community sensitization strategies and independent monitoring. Evidence Action works with the government of Cross River State in Nigeria to establish the school-based component of an integrated Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) program, in partnership with RTI International, which supports the community-based component. The Kenya deworming team supported new team members in Nigeria and state government officials, providing input on the cascade design, training and community sensitization materials, and independent monitoring. Evidence Action is proud to share lessons learned from Kenya’s strong deworming programme with implementing government ministries in Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, India, and Vietnam. # Lessons learned from the programme, studies and other countries\n\nThe past four years have offered programme partners an opportunity to improve over time in terms of relevant participation at various levels, better fiscal management, improved working relationships among partners and responsiveness to feedback received from implementers. The lessons have come from all aspects of program implementation, and have led to merging some trainings, adopting new community sensitization approaches and dropping redundant ones, merging budgets to increase efficiency, and more. These adaptations have led to increased coverage. Prevalence surveys carried out by KEMRI have shown that deworming of school children alone may not be the solution to eradicating worms. Proposals from counties have been to incorporate other interventions such as community deworming and WASH programmes. The way forward may be to establish which interventions need to be combined and to bring together the various stakeholders to come up with a new ways of tapping these synergies towards the established goal.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0DsZs7rrEwQKiO4FXy8v+3hF05CKk8Qrj/exl+1zQLE="},"898dc5e5-a5aa-4835-97c9-da8136584997":{"id_":"898dc5e5-a5aa-4835-97c9-da8136584997","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d5658c9a-c387-4013-aa14-7f22a8006fe8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"0DsZs7rrEwQKiO4FXy8v+3hF05CKk8Qrj/exl+1zQLE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ae15cc0e-5559-42c1-90c4-d328eead981c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"5ADdybgfH7PuEYzVc96SCC4NsTXcf7ZPVRNmaRo5KCc="}},"text":"---\n# National Treatment Coverage Map\n\nThe coverage areas of the National School-Based Deworming Programme include 27 counties across 145 sub-counties in Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Coast, North Eastern, Eastern, and Central regions in Kenya as depicted in the map below. # Implementation counties include:\n\n|Bomet|Kericho|Kwale|Nandi|Tana River|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Bungoma|Kilifi|Lamu|Narok|Trans Nzoia|\n|Busia|Kirinyaga|Machakos|Nyamira|Vihiga|\n|Garissa|Kisii|Makueni|Siaya|Wajir|\n|Homa Bay|Kisumu|Migori|Taita| |\n|Kakamega|Kitui|Mombasa|Taveta| |\n\nTargeted and dewormed for STH and Schistosomiasis\n\nTargeted and dewormed for STH Only\n\n# Kenya National School Based Deworming Programme\n---\n# Kenya National School Based Deworming Programme\n\n# Evidence Behind School-Based Deworming\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming Programme is based on rigorous evidence that deworming has a significant impact on children’s health and education. # THE PROBLEM\n\n# What are Worms? Worms, or minyoo in Swahili, are parasites that live in the human intestines and bladder for survival. There are two types of worms treated by the Kenya School-Based Deworming Programme: soil-transmitted helminths (STH, or common worms) and schistosomes (which cause schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia). Worm infection is a chronic condition that can cause anemia and malnutrition, impairing children’s mental and physical development and posing a serious threat to their health, education, and productivity. Children infected with worms can become too sick or tired to concentrate at school, or even to attend school at all. # THE SOLUTION\n\n# Why Deworming? Deworming children helps them grow, stay healthy and improve their educational attainment. The benefits of deworming are immediate, as it has a positive impact on the children who receive treatment as well as their siblings and other children who live nearby.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"v3R6s211ba77zgJu+vujV/+GmEMVBKwfltSIS8XUX1A="},"ae15cc0e-5559-42c1-90c4-d328eead981c":{"id_":"ae15cc0e-5559-42c1-90c4-d328eead981c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"898dc5e5-a5aa-4835-97c9-da8136584997","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"v3R6s211ba77zgJu+vujV/+GmEMVBKwfltSIS8XUX1A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3e5ac134-a368-4ee5-9810-fe9b233fe930","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"jBIegglVtr07LvEtKfCui1mGbqmPmksA7OWN+Z7i1Oo="}},"text":"Deworming also has long-term impact on critical factors for well-being, including education, health, and long-term productivity. # Why School-Based Deworming? School-age children typically have the highest intensity of worm infection compared to any other age group. School-based deworming reaches children where they are – at school. Schools offer a readily available, extensive and sustained infrastructure that makes the programme cost-effective and operationally feasible. # THE IMPACT\n\n# How Does School-Based Deworming Benefit Children? Rigorous evidence shows that mass deworming is a cost-effective solution that transforms the lives of children over the short and long term. Deworming treatment leads to significant weight gain and allows more energy to be focused on child growth and development. A study in Uganda, for example, found that deworming increased child weight by 10% for children who received treatment twice per year, and by 5% for children who received treatment annually1. School-based mass deworming has also shown to reduce school absenteeism more cost-effectively than alternative ways of boosting school attendance. In Kenya, school-based mass deworming reduced school absenteeism by 25% for those in treatment schools2. Furthermore, deworming has spillover effects for untreated school-age and preschool children. In Kenya, young siblings of those treated, as well as children who lived nearby treatment schools but were too young to be dewormed, showed gains in cognitive development equal to half a year of schooling when evaluated ten years later3. The benefits of school-based deworming extend beyond short-term health and educational impacts. Studies have shown long-run educational and labor market benefits as a result of investment in mass deworming. Men who were dewormed as children stayed enrolled in school for a longer period of time, worked 3.4 more hours each week in the labor force, and were more likely to work in higher-wage manufacturing jobs. Women who were treated as children were more likely to pass national primary school exit exams and were 25% more likely to have attended secondary school4. As a result of labor market gains, investing in school-based deworming may generate more government revenue in the long-run than it costs in government subsidies4. # References\n\n1.

The cascade brings together personnel from the two ministries through collaborative leadership responsibilities for the planning, implementation and monitoring of programme activities at all levels. At the national level, the programme trains “Master Trainers” who are personnel from Ministries of Health and Education based in implementing counties. The programme also requisitions deworming tablets, and develops/prints implementation strategies, training materials and monitoring tools. Thereafter, the cascade is initiated as depicted below:\n\n# 1 - County Planning and Sensitization Meeting\n\nBefore implementation takes place within each county, the County Directors of Education and Health convene a meeting, facilitated by the National Programme team, where county and sub-county-level personnel are sensitized on the programme and their managerial roles.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jBIegglVtr07LvEtKfCui1mGbqmPmksA7OWN+Z7i1Oo="},"03d580d0-be3d-4916-90e4-2d41ee9a53d3":{"id_":"03d580d0-be3d-4916-90e4-2d41ee9a53d3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3e5ac134-a368-4ee5-9810-fe9b233fe930","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"jBIegglVtr07LvEtKfCui1mGbqmPmksA7OWN+Z7i1Oo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"43554050-5953-461b-807b-39213171db78","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"j7aIM8FJEUW6UQLeZQ7IuVwODAVJI328JZrCUROx884="}},"text":"This is a critical meeting, as the programme gains buy-in and builds partnerships by engaging with county-level structures in Kenya.

Tablets are given to all children aged 2-14 years, including those enrolled in primary schools, in nearby Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centres, and those from the surrounding community who are not enrolled in school. Teachers also fill in monitoring forms to record the number of children dewormed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"j7aIM8FJEUW6UQLeZQ7IuVwODAVJI328JZrCUROx884="},"ac488b10-848e-4e53-9868-ec92cffffaad":{"id_":"ac488b10-848e-4e53-9868-ec92cffffaad","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"43554050-5953-461b-807b-39213171db78","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"j7aIM8FJEUW6UQLeZQ7IuVwODAVJI328JZrCUROx884="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"441f895d-11c3-4f75-89df-8dc1643f3762","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"n2OmB5L0/AiyS7MYuUib+vYuQZQkv63hxET/XzAQawc="}},"text":"Teachers also fill in monitoring forms to record the number of children dewormed.

The SCDE is responsible for sharing the data with the SCMOH and County personnel and for returning the forms, along with financial accountability documentation to the National Secretariat for data analysis and financial management. Any remaining deworming tablets at the schools are collected by the CSOs and then given to the division-level Public Health Officer who fills a tablet tracking form that calculates the number of unused tablets. These are distributed to the local health facilities for use in community deworming (after approval by the SCMOH). The tracking form is then shared with the SCDE and County personnel, and is eventually returned, along with financial accountability documentation, to the National Secretariat for data analysis, donor reporting and financial management. Ultimately, the Reverse Cascade process is critical for the calculation of the number of children treated, the quantities of tablets used and redistributed to the community, and the overall success of the programme.

parasitology and impact monitoring and evaluation. Results from this work are useful in making fundamental decisions on treatment targeting, thus helping the programme maintain its evidence-based targeting approach as described in detail below. # Programme Targeting\n\nScientists from KEMRI help define the programme’s targeted geographies. In 2009, they defined the initial targets when they determined that the prevalence and intensity of worm infection (both STH and SCH) in sub-counties in Western, Nyanza, Coast and parts of Rift Valley regions justified treating every child in identified areas through a mass drug administration (MDA) campaign. Subsequently, KEMRI conducted parasitological surveys in additional areas for schistosomiasis, leading to an increase in the following target areas for schistosomiasis:\n\n- In 2012-2013, the programme added Nyanza, Coast and parts of Central regions to its schistosomiasis-treating regions. - In 2013-2014, the programme added high-risk schistosomiasis areas in Eastern, Central and North Eastern for treatment based on school-based questionnaires assessing whether children had indicated blood in urine (BIU), and parasitology surveys. - In 2014-2015, KEMRI conducted parasitology surveys in North Eastern region to reconfirm BIU findings, resulting in reduction of the number of targeted counties and schools. # Programme Monitoring & Impact Report\n\nEach year, beginning in January 2012, the Ministry of Health, through KEMRI’s Eastern and Southern Africa Centre of International Parasite Control (ESACIPAC) has been conducting objective school-level surveys assessing the prevalence and mean intensity for all three types of STH (hookworm, whipworm, and roundworm) and Schistosomia mansoni and S. haematobium in school-age children. These surveys, which analyze the impact of deworming over time, take place before and after deworming in a randomized selection of 60 schools drawn from 20 sub-counties distributed across 16 Counties in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Coast regions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oI4izzWA5YyXB5Za2c/PYjGEOSY4YTz1d0YhH9KRANE="},"4f3e8891-4a29-4601-9dd2-6d43a16f940a":{"id_":"4f3e8891-4a29-4601-9dd2-6d43a16f940a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"4HQF1dc2q4n8BBuKgEUd142iP6+/No8e395V8Efo6iw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b22510e9-d36c-47a5-a464-96c70fd5c114","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"oI4izzWA5YyXB5Za2c/PYjGEOSY4YTz1d0YhH9KRANE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d3e40c7e-15ce-4eda-80c4-d5b285d5cdb5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 4 Treatment Results Booklet_2016.pdf"},"hash":"Ajr11KA5il11G+coq2SopKBnAhaXUrEIWy5aATVmVzc="}},"text":"During the fourth year of NSBDP implementation, the KEMRI team analyzed samples of stool and urine from 6,295 children in 60 schools before deworming and 5,015 children after deworming in 48 schools to determine their worm prevalence rates.

Cognisant of this, the Ministry of Education supports programmes that promote health for children as well as systems that can provide them a quality education. Robust policies have been put in place to achieve these goals such as the National School Health Policy and Guidelines (2009; currently under review) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. The last fourteen years have seen a significant rise in school enrolment rates, following the Free Primary Education policy that was introduced in 2003. Primary school enrolment increased from 62% in 2002 to 86% by 2012, positioning schools as an efficient and effective platform to provide certain health programmes that target children. One such programme is National School-Based Deworming, which has consistently dewormed approximately 6 million children every year for the last five years (2012-2017). This represents 85% of all school-age children living in endemic areas. We are proud to have been a part of this great success, and we will continue to assert our unequivocal commitment to school-based deworming through the next five-year phase (2017-2022). We stand ready to work alongside our partners to increase our role in programme coordination and management during this phase, working hand-in-hand with our colleagues in the Ministry of Health. We recognize the comparable dedication of the Ministry of Health and acknowledge their assurance of the same. The children cannot be treated at such an expansive scale without the support of county, sub county and ward/division level officers from the Ministry of Education. The commitment of teachers does not go unrecognized in tirelessly implementing at the last mile, as they administer tablets to children.

Kwa Afya na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! Dr. Belio Kipsang, CBS\n\nPrincipal Secretary, Ministry of Education\n---\n# Message from the Ministry of Health\n\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have been identified as a cause of morbidity and disability in many African countries. The June 2012 Accra Urgent Call to Action petitioned for accelerated efforts to eliminate targeted NTDs in the Africa Region. This is in line with the World Health Assembly’s adoption of resolutions to scale up interventions against infections such as soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis. The Ministry of Health is fully committed to this, and toward this end, launched the 2nd Kenya National Strategic Plan for the Control of NTDs (2016-2020) as well as the National School Health Policy and Guidelines 2009 (under review) that codify and coordinate approaches to control these diseases. The burden of STH and schistosomiasis is heaviest among pre-school and school-age children. The effects of worm infection can be chronic and may cause malnutrition, anemia and increased vulnerability to other illnesses. This is a public health problem that the Ministry is dedicated to managing, namely through a collaboration of the Neonatal Child and Adolescent Health and NTD Units. The last five years (2012-2017) are a testament to this commitment, evidenced by our partnership with the Ministry of Education to treat at-risk children through the school system. Together, we have seen children across endemic counties treated once a year, every year under National School-Based Deworming. In 2017 alone, nearly 6 million children in 145 sub counties received treatment, surpassing the 75% coverage target set by the WHO. We are truly proud to be a part of such an effective programme. Having now completed five years of consistent treatment coupled with rigorous monitoring, we look forward to the opportunity to evaluate the programme’s impact to date. The Ministry looks forward to integrating improved environmental sanitation, use of safe water and hygiene with robust health education.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h/ZwYk41Q72X3zitX3BQxKUTv/wecepWLayUPa6yUws="},"546b7330-786e-439e-a82a-1c6d71d4d800":{"id_":"546b7330-786e-439e-a82a-1c6d71d4d800","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9a473a9f-f169-43eb-a502-2ec61735ac6e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"h/ZwYk41Q72X3zitX3BQxKUTv/wecepWLayUPa6yUws="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"33868843-e603-430b-b4c6-a0f130d70a5a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"YrnzX9Ps/63gHqjm+RvFxOHHujlc/6YeawwPva3pTYo="}},"text":"We will use the evidence to further guide the programme’s success toward the goal of ensuring that worms are no longer a public health problem for the children of Kenya.

The goal of the programme is to eliminate worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya. Since 2012, it has aimed to treat at least 5 million Kenyan children each year and targets all children aged 2-14 years in at-risk sub counties, regardless of their enrolment status. In Kenya, more than 5 million school-age children are at risk of intestinal parasitic worms, including soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomes, which have a negative impact on their health and education. The Government of Kenya recognizes that the health and education of its children are key in building a bright future. As such, it has prioritized NSBD, embedding it in policies that guide its alignment with national strategies, and ultimately promoting sustainable impact.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YrnzX9Ps/63gHqjm+RvFxOHHujlc/6YeawwPva3pTYo="},"68cd5f99-de9a-4cdf-b2bb-7be691e1bb93":{"id_":"68cd5f99-de9a-4cdf-b2bb-7be691e1bb93","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"33868843-e603-430b-b4c6-a0f130d70a5a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"YrnzX9Ps/63gHqjm+RvFxOHHujlc/6YeawwPva3pTYo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"45309293-cca6-4cb9-a021-b87ff9aced97","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"6c5nL/AySLFWwIs7j7QHFBP3XWo6hDTQgSD9pqIrKXI="}},"text":"These include:\n\n- National School Health Policy and Guidelines (2009) (currently under review), which prioritize deworming under the thematic area of disease prevention and control\n- The 2nd Kenya National Strategic Plan For Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2016-2020), which identifies school-based deworming as one of the treatment strategies for the control of STH and schistosomiasis\n\nAlong with these policies, the programme is also an activity under the National School Health Programme at the Ministries of Health and Education, which promotes the health and educational development of pupils and the health of the community. This contribution to health is also emphasized as one of the Kenya Vision 2030 social pillars alongside education and training. The deworming programme was piloted in 2009, when 3.6 million children were treated. Following the success of this first mass drug administration (MDA) round, it expanded to national scale and has since dewormed 5.9 million, 6.4 million, 6.2 million, 6.4 million and 5.9 million children in 2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 respectively. Treatment takes place in schools across areas endemic for parasitic worms, according to WHO treatment thresholds. Regularly providing deworming tablets to children through schools is a proven, cost-effective and safe treatment strategy due to the readily available, extensive and sustained educational infrastructure. WHO has certified the safety of administration of deworming tablets by teachers with support from the local health system. While initiated and managed at the national level, NSBD is implemented at the county level. Personnel from the two ministries play a joint leadership role in ensuring that the programme is implemented in every school within targeted areas. The programme is implemented with technical, fiscal and administrative support from Evidence Action’s Deworm the World Initiative, which provides technical assistance to governments to launch, strengthen and sustain mass school-based deworming programmes. Evidence Action works directly with governments to scale and support high-quality implementation of programmes targeting all at-risk school-age children.

Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# The Case for School-Based Deworming\n\n# The evidence base\n\nGlobally, 1.5 billion people - nearly 1 in 4 of the world’s population - are infected with STH. Further, approximately 200 million are infected with schistosomiasis. Worm transmission is perpetuated in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. School-age children typically hold the highest burden and intensity of infections, and are particularly susceptible to developmental and behavioural deficits caused by worms. Worms interfere with nutrient uptake, leading to anaemia, malnourishment, impaired cognition and physical development, lower school attendance and performance, and reduced economic productivity in adulthood. By leveraging existing school infrastructure, school-based deworming programmes can capitalize on a captive audience and engage widely trusted people (teachers) to deliver medication, resulting in high take-up. School-based deworming can reach upwards of 80% of school-age children through national programmes implemented by Ministries of Health and Education. # The impact\n\nRigorous evidence shows that mass deworming is a cost-effective solution that transforms the lives of children over the short and long term. School-based mass deworming has reduced school absenteeism more cost-effectively than alternative ways of boosting attendance. In a quasi-experimental trial in Kenya, school-based mass deworming reduced absenteeism by 25%1. Deworming may also have positive spillover effects: in Kenya, young siblings of those treated, as well as children who lived nearby treatment schools but were too young to be dewormed, showed gains in cognitive development equal to half a year of schooling when evaluated ten years later2. Systematic reviews have also shown that deworming treatment leads to statistically significant weight gain in infected children3, which allows more of a child’s energy to be focused on growth and development. In a randomized health intervention, Indian preschool children were given iron supplements, vitamin A and deworming treatment, with a positive gain in weight and school participation compared to provision of vitamin A alone4.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6c5nL/AySLFWwIs7j7QHFBP3XWo6hDTQgSD9pqIrKXI="},"8093ef4e-2c8e-4896-aef1-2e40b3f5c1be":{"id_":"8093ef4e-2c8e-4896-aef1-2e40b3f5c1be","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"45309293-cca6-4cb9-a021-b87ff9aced97","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"6c5nL/AySLFWwIs7j7QHFBP3XWo6hDTQgSD9pqIrKXI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"50fedac6-f857-4a82-ae6e-7b5572902f00","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"mEA93dtH3in+KQd72rVzzDD4pTJZu8Jbhd25H0jRfBk="}},"text":"The benefits of school-based deworming extend beyond short-term health and educational impacts.

Women who were treated as children were more likely to pass primary school exit exams and to have attended secondary school.

As the programme continues, partners will seek to maintain strong and collaborative governance structures that align and respond to Kenya’s larger policy context. Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo! ---\n# Implementing Deworming: The Cascade\n\nNational School-Based Deworming uses a cascade implementation model that efficiently and cost-effectively delivers training, deworming tablets, monitoring forms, funds, and other programme materials and resources from the national level to schools. The cascade brings together personnel from the two ministries through collaborative leadership for the planning, implementation and monitoring of programme activities at all levels. At the national level, the NSBD trains “Master Trainers” who are personnel from Ministries of Health and Education based in implementing counties. The programme also requisitions deworming tablets, develops implementation strategies, and produces training materials and monitoring tools. Thereafter, the cascade is initiated as below:\n\n# 1. County Planning and Sensitisation Meeting\n\nBefore implementation, County Directors of Education and Health convene a meeting where county and sub county-level personnel are sensitised on the programme and their managerial roles.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mEA93dtH3in+KQd72rVzzDD4pTJZu8Jbhd25H0jRfBk="},"918e4069-d6b5-45fd-92b0-3b367c788059":{"id_":"918e4069-d6b5-45fd-92b0-3b367c788059","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"50fedac6-f857-4a82-ae6e-7b5572902f00","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"mEA93dtH3in+KQd72rVzzDD4pTJZu8Jbhd25H0jRfBk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a35770fb-259b-49b8-b03f-4194531e9f16","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"20gaYDB833lmgKz0Qs3NK7AwA3vJ7jZiJiAQO7O0qwc="}},"text":"This is a critical meeting, as the programme gains buy-in and builds partnerships by engaging with county-level structures in Kenya.

The SCDE shares the data with the SCMOH and County personnel and returns the forms, along with financial accountability documentation, to the national level for data analysis and financial management. Any remaining deworming tablets at the schools are collected by the CSOs and then given to the Division-level Public Health Officer (DivPHO) who fills a tracking form to show the number of unused tablets. The DivPHO submits extra, unopened tins and the summary form to the SCMOH for safe storage and use in the next round of deworming, provided expiry dates allow retaining the tablets. For opened tins, the SCMOH confirms and records the quantities, and redistributes the tablets to health facilities. The SCMOH then submits the record or “tablet form” to the NTD Unit indicating the numbers of unused tablets, their expiry dates, and where they have been redistributed. Ultimately, the reverse cascade is critical for determining the number of children treated, the quantities of deworming tablets used and the overall success of the programme.

According to KEMRI reports, NSBD has reduced the prevalence and intensity as well as reinfection of both STH and schistosomiasis among its target population over the last 5 years. In Year 1, NSBD set an annual target of a 60% immediate reduction in post-treatment prevalence and intensity for both STH and schistosomiasis infections. The data indicate that this target for any STH infection has been met annually for years 1-5.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bzmxLF1E6pIHYUG6Q0vuAzZqsLHvzvsItIaB2Fg0zNU="},"78aae897-f549-4d79-96ee-f0c686595c7d":{"id_":"78aae897-f549-4d79-96ee-f0c686595c7d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dc85174b-503a-43cf-b94e-44241e39cd5b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"bzmxLF1E6pIHYUG6Q0vuAzZqsLHvzvsItIaB2Fg0zNU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dd279cb6-efbf-43d5-865c-2816a1d98564","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"USKHHLD72i1JDhGd5EoWc9HrnjbxbVfb+dkwRj7fR/k="}},"text":"There has also been a significant overall reduction (67%) in prevalence of any schistosome infection from years 1 to 5. Detailed results from KEMRI’s parasitological monitoring are further described in the section titled “Programme monitoring and evaluation. ”\n\nDrug management has evolved over the first five-year phase. Initially, any leftover drugs were redistributed to health facilities for routine use. However, this posed a challenge for clarifying inventory and procurement needs. As lead of the WHO drug requisition process and head of the programme’s drugs technical working group, the NTD Unit revised the drugs protocol such that the SCMOH stores unopened tins with long expiry dates at the sub county stores for future deworming rounds, and redistributes only open tins to health facilities, keeping a clear record of each. Engagement with master trainers also changed over the first five years. In years 1 and 2, the programme worked with national-level Master Trainers. Beginning in year 3, however, a cohort of county-based Master Trainers was established in response to devolution within the country. Engaging counties in this way increased their ownership, responsibility and accountability in the programme’s execution. At the start of the programme, deworming treatment was provided in 15 waves. This came with logistical challenges and high costs of distributing materials, carrying out trainings and monitoring activities. By the third year, the waves were reduced to two – a cost-effective approach that has allowed the programme to gain national-level attention by having most counties undertaking deworming on the same day. While deworming has typically been implemented more widely in public schools, the programme has been able to significantly expand its engagement with private schools over the years. The number of private schools participating in NSBD has risen steadily from 4,853 in year 2 to 5,957 in year 5. Meanwhile, the number of non-enrolled children treated has decreased from 764,231 in year 1 to 379,029 in year 5, as an effect of Kenyan government policy, which increased enrolment rates through universal primary education. Even as enrolment increases, NSBD partners strive to extend much-needed treatment to hard-to-reach children. For instance, in year 5, programme partners tracked the migration patterns of mobile schools in nomadic pastoralist communities in Tana River county.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VoL4ui+bKWn4fEKmp9RBd1VyigjhwhtHNqg7qJzU+RA="},"dd279cb6-efbf-43d5-865c-2816a1d98564":{"id_":"dd279cb6-efbf-43d5-865c-2816a1d98564","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"78aae897-f549-4d79-96ee-f0c686595c7d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"VoL4ui+bKWn4fEKmp9RBd1VyigjhwhtHNqg7qJzU+RA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"31bb962e-72b7-4a13-b27b-eeef6bac8dca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"/R/fd6UBIeYroaLKH4a1CPw2N2TR+A48uqLNWeCwAc0="}},"text":"Teachers at these schools migrate together with their communities and teach using supplies carried by camels provided by the Ministry of Education’s National Council for Nomadic Education. Persistent follow-up with teachers as they prepared for deworming day ultimately ensured that treatment reached more vulnerable children. Sensitising entire communities requires approaches that are both effective and cost conscious. Initially the programme relied on CHEWs and town announcers to give visibility to the programme at the community level. In the second year of the programme, some counties also engaged local radio stations to talk about the\n---\n# Programme Overview\n\nThis proved useful in encouraging buy-in from the community, and was adopted more widely as a sensitisation method from year 3 onward to complement the community-wide influence that CHEWs achieve. # Response to Devolution\n\nThe programme was one of the first to respond to devolution in Kenya, as set forth by the 2010 constitution and effected in 2013. From 2013 onward, as the programme and the country’s administrative structures became more stable, aspects of planning (such as quantification of materials) became more predictable and set the stage for the programme to achieve several cost efficiencies. Printing for a full year of activities was done in a single batch in Years 4 and 5 ultimately reducing printing costs by over 55%. County school health subcommittee meetings were also reduced from four to two annual meetings in year 4, leading to a 15% cost reduction in years 4 and 5. Budgets for county planning meetings, sub-county trainings, teacher trainings, and deworming day activities all decreased from year 3 to year 5. # What’s Next\n\nHaving celebrated five successful years of high-impact collaboration and life-enriching treatment for millions of children, programme partners maintain a strong commitment to a vision for a worm-free Kenya. A second five-year phase of national deworming has already begun, codified by a partnership agreement between the Ministries of Health and Education and technical assistance partner Evidence Action, spanning 2017-2022. As noted in the agreement, all partners share a goal to build upon the government’s ownership of the programme by transitioning tasks and responsibilities from Evidence Action to government implementers using a strategic, stepwise approach. Co-developed work plans and annual targets will provide a guiding framework to achieve this goal.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"USKHHLD72i1JDhGd5EoWc9HrnjbxbVfb+dkwRj7fR/k="},"31bb962e-72b7-4a13-b27b-eeef6bac8dca":{"id_":"31bb962e-72b7-4a13-b27b-eeef6bac8dca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dd279cb6-efbf-43d5-865c-2816a1d98564","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"USKHHLD72i1JDhGd5EoWc9HrnjbxbVfb+dkwRj7fR/k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c5f970df-2c46-4020-ab68-dd92e73f45e2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"uSnQlWQP2l0F3h34fZJviX7hsHkw/KPGveDLzSN7H8c="}},"text":"Co-developed work plans and annual targets will provide a guiding framework to achieve this goal. As partnering ministries continue implementing NSBD, they also look to identify additional resources that can complement existing contributions of personnel time and in-kind resources that have been the programme’s foundation to date. # Global Model\n\nKenya’s NSBD has become a global model for cross-sectoral collaboration and evidence-based programme implementation at scale. To maintain this reputation, NSBD must remain aligned to relevant national policies and strategies, WHO and global guidelines and best practices, and the best available scientific evidence. This will include alignment to the reviewed School Health Policy forthcoming from the Ministry of Health. Leaders from the Ministries of Health and Education now have a concrete and immediate opportunity to review and use the wealth of context-specific evidence in Kenya, including parasitological mapping, treatment and impact monitoring data, to ensure that the programme makes any adjustments necessary to continue a comprehensive and appropriate treatment targeting strategy in its second phase. # Extending Collaboration\n\nFinally, the Ministries can continue and extend the NSBD’s spirit of cross-sectoral collaboration by identifying points of synergy with stakeholders pursuing complementary goals in areas such as improved water, sanitation, and hygiene in schools or communities, or robust health education and promotion. By further leveraging partnerships and domestic resources, the Government of Kenya can maximize the likelihood of eliminating worms as a public health problem.

the country, according to the prevalence of STH and schistosomiasis. The former Western, Nyanza, Coastal regions, and parts of Rift Valley were targeted for widespread annual STH treatment, with all except Western requiring some schistosomiasis treatment as well. Additional schistosomiasis treatment was needed in areas of Eastern, Central, and North Eastern regions where this disease was endemic. Unlike STH, schistosomiasis is focally distributed, requiring more specific targeting; this is done by determining the prevalence, as assessed by surveys of stool or urine samples in school-age children according to WHO guidelines. In the case of NSBD, it was determined that areas endemic for schistosomiasis alone should also receive complementary STH treatment, given the operational and cost efficiencies of bundling the treatments. However, there have been some fluctuations in numbers of sub counties receiving schistosomiasis treatment. Because of lower prevalence levels, some areas only required the treatment on alternating years, but there were some unplanned fluctuations in the treatment areas as well. For instance, in Year 3, most sub counties missed treatment due to a drug stock-out. # Number of sub-counties treating for schistosomiasis\n\n|Year|Number of Sub-Counties|\n|---|---|\n|Year 1|14|\n|Year 2|63|\n|Year 3|6 (note: in Year 3, drug stock-outs prevented most treatment from taking place)|\n|Year 4|68|\n|Year 5|44|\n\n# Counties Covered by the Programme\n\n|Treated for STH and Schistosomiasis|Treated for STH and Schistosomiasis in Year 2 Only|Treated for STH Only|\n|---|---|---|\n|Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo!|Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo!|Kwa Afya Na Elimu Bora, Tuangamize Minyoo!|\n---\n# Monitoring and evaluation\n\nKEMRI is the national body responsible for carrying out health research in Kenya and a key partner in NSBD.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FB8nQxtdB5q2J1q9OvnoJGsUGxIjsK/xKDyBzjZrSko="},"9b694bed-9e3b-4a24-bc88-4a3fb139bed1":{"id_":"9b694bed-9e3b-4a24-bc88-4a3fb139bed1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"39507f66-b364-4b9f-9669-cffad35d071f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"FB8nQxtdB5q2J1q9OvnoJGsUGxIjsK/xKDyBzjZrSko="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"34c1c2dd-ee3c-4908-997c-9d7fb3745e21","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"p1qDXyRxo10SvJimneH4zFvtNdepo1cBOdzRG5sugDc="}},"text":"Through its renowned international experts in STH and schistosomiasis, KEMRI provides technical support in mapping, parasitology, monitoring, and impact evaluation. Results from this work guide fundamental decisions on treatment targeting, helping NSBD maintain its evidence-based approach as described in detail below. # Programme Targeting\n\nScientists from KEMRI help define the programme’s targeted geographies. For instance, in 2009, they provided data showing that the prevalence and intensity of STH infection in sub counties in Western, Nyanza, Coast and parts of Rift Valley regions justified treating every child in identified areas through MDA. Each year, parasitological analyses have informed decisions on programme scope, including:\n\n- In year 2, the programme added high-risk schistosomiasis areas in Eastern, Central and North Eastern regions for treatment due to results from parasitology surveys and school-based questionnaires assessing whether children had blood in urine (BIU). - In year 3, KEMRI conducted schistosomiasis mapping in North Eastern region to reconfirm BIU findings, ultimately reducing the number of targeted counties and schools to maintain an evidence-based treatment strategy. # Impact Monitoring Strategy\n\nEach year since January 2012, KEMRI’s Eastern and Southern Africa Centre of International Parasite Control (ESACIPAC) conducts a series of repeat cross-sectional school-level surveys capturing worm prevalence and intensity for three types of STH (hookworm, whipworm—specifically Trichuris trichiura, and roundworm—specifically Ascaris lumbricoides) and schistosome infections (Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium) in school-age children. These surveys assess the impact of deworming over time and include 200 schools drawn from 20 sub counties across 16 counties in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Coast regions. The strategic distribution of sampling sites allows the surveys to establish an accurate measurement of infection at the national level. The schools were surveyed at baseline (year 1), with follow-up in year 3 and again in year 5. In a subset of 60 of these schools, surveys were conducted pre- and post- treatment each year to evaluate immediate reductions in infections, which can be directly linked to programme implementation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"eZdPjG8k0tifRHcue6apqo9nW8pD4gr/enZIlGEv4p4="},"34c1c2dd-ee3c-4908-997c-9d7fb3745e21":{"id_":"34c1c2dd-ee3c-4908-997c-9d7fb3745e21","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9b694bed-9e3b-4a24-bc88-4a3fb139bed1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"eZdPjG8k0tifRHcue6apqo9nW8pD4gr/enZIlGEv4p4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"36335a72-2a9f-400d-a81f-7d14d62a26fe","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"wH9qaydoJKK4ITelKzraiPIOFJwb3bsbo60mTjrEDrk="}},"text":"# Programme monitoring and impact report\n\nDuring the fifth year of NSBD implementation, KEMRI analyzed stool and urine samples of 21,045 children from 199 schools before deworming and 6,280 children from 60 schools after deworming to determine prevalence and intensity of infection.

The overall reduction in STH prevalence is a useful measure of programme impact and likely reflects high, and sustained, treatment coverage throughout this period; however, lack of treatment delivery for schistosomiasis in parts of some programme areas during years 1 and 3 may have affected reductions in prevalence for both schistosome species. # Using Programme Evidence to Inform Future Treatment Strategy\n\nThe prevalence and intensity of STH combined and species-specific infections decreased significantly after five rounds of MDA. There were also significant immediate reductions in STH prevalence and intensity seen in all five programme years. This is encouraging progress toward the NSBD’s goal of eliminating worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya. However, worm prevalence and intensity remain at a level that warrants continued regular mass treatment for at-risk children, according to WHO guidelines. It is critical that the programme continues to treat in all at-risk areas to sustain the gains made to date. Moving into the next phase of the programme, there is a need for implementation and technical assistance partners to review and examine all relevant parasitological and mapping data to ensure that the programme continues to operate from a sound treatment strategy informed by the best available evidence. Only with a strategic and data-driven targeting approach can the programme continue its high impact and hallmark cost-effectiveness. As much as mass drug administration can result in significant prevalence reductions, drug therapy alone is only a short-term measure of reducing worm infection and reinfection, and additional complementary interventions need to be considered as well.

END Fund does this by:\n\n1. Mobilizing and directing resources to where they can have maximum impact,\n2. Advocating for innovative, integrated, and cost-effective NTD programmes, and\n3. Facilitating private sector engagement in the movement to address the devastating effects of NTDs. In line with this strategy, one of the END Fund’s core competencies and activities is the ongoing mapping and assessment of the NTD landscape of partners, projects, national plans, programme implementing organizations, and Ministry of Health capacity across disease-endemic countries. The END Fund proactively assesses where resource investment can most efficiently and effectively move forward the NTD control and elimination agenda. The END Fund then makes strategic investment recommendations to donors engaging in the cause. Where no existing qualified program implementing partner exists, the END Fund at times implements NTD programmes in partnership with Ministries of Health.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vky6KeFJ57B315WnqGMXNVAeV9sh8R5NfeJ+HRX5ojQ="},"2b398b9d-6bc5-4768-8fe3-b4564ecab348":{"id_":"2b398b9d-6bc5-4768-8fe3-b4564ecab348","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"id2diXk9BF5gbu0BFUjts/UTRgXVi7+z5RhSfx/N2sw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"14b19e85-29dd-4a98-ad14-e105e229727f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 5 Treatment Results Booklet_2017.pdf"},"hash":"vky6KeFJ57B315WnqGMXNVAeV9sh8R5NfeJ+HRX5ojQ="}},"text":"For more information, visit www.end.org.

It helps people realise their full potential, and expand their connections with the world. The Government of Kenya (GoK), through the Ministry of Education (MOE), is focused on ensuring that every Kenyan child has access to quality education. This is an extension of the Kenya Constitution (2010), chapter four, that guarantees all Kenyans their socio-cultural and economic rights, including the right to education, health, and decent livelihoods. Consequently, the MOE has established policies to help achieve its goals, including the 2nd Kenya School Health Policy (2018) implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH). This policy defines an approach through the Comprehensive School Health Programme that provides targeted school-based health services to at-risk school-age children. The National School-Based Deworming (NSBD) programme is one such initiative that aims to improve children’s health so as to achieve access and equity in education. The NSBD programme plays a critical role in ensuring the health of children as an important contribution to their educational outcomes and has treated children for parasitic worms annually since 2012. Evidence shows that deworming improves children’s educational outcomes by reducing absenteeism and, consequently, is synergistic to Kenya’s Free Primary Education initiative. The programme serves as a global model of school-based deworming and successfully treated 6.3 million children in over 18,000 primary schools across 161 sub-counties in its sixth year. The collaboration between the MOE and MOH exemplifies the benefits of strengthening inter-ministerial approaches to interventions that change lives in our communities. There remains a need to sustain the existing gains and ensure that worms are no longer a public health problem for children in Kenya. We will continue to support the partnership in the seventh year and beyond through collaborative MOE personnel at all levels of government and in communities, providing training venues, and pursuing our vision of increased financial ownership and coordination support.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WOxEUDP/ge6tCu2FZxDnIkRf8u9YYjoKJTaX0LuKzXM="},"538d89f2-5489-4653-abbf-df182a50367b":{"id_":"538d89f2-5489-4653-abbf-df182a50367b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"51452b4e-c11d-4c13-910d-c0e7a9dc9894","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"WOxEUDP/ge6tCu2FZxDnIkRf8u9YYjoKJTaX0LuKzXM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"29a33a50-89d4-4957-81b9-130cabe9b0b9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"5SxeO1jhc2Y6FnBuIH8eWHRA1UB/PkPqhqLK50RZCcs="}},"text":"The success we see today would not be possible without support from the School Health Nutrition and Meals Unit, regional coordinators, County and Sub county Directors of Education, ward level officers and teachers, and technical support provided by the MOH at national and county levels.

The effect of worm infection among these cohorts can be chronic and may cause malnutrition, anaemia, and increased susceptibility to other illnesses. Worm infection is indeed a public health problem that the MOH is committed to managing through collaborations between the Neonatal, Child & Adolescent Health Unit (NCAHU), Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Unit, Health Promotion Unit, and the Division of Environmental Health. Control of these worms, among other diseases, is guided by the 2nd Kenya School Health Policy (2018), and the 2nd Kenya National Strategic Plan for the Control of NTDs (2016-2020). Health of our citizens has a direct effect on the social and economic indicators of a nation; it determines the potential of individuals to contribute significantly to the economy. School-age children make up about 42% of our total population, and ill health is an impediment to achievement of their full potential. The global burden of worm infection prompted World Health Assembly resolutions to scale up interventions against NTDs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZzyoDwGAry1QIN1bMupmlfxP/AUG18Uqj/DNOm2C39M="},"29a33a50-89d4-4957-81b9-130cabe9b0b9":{"id_":"29a33a50-89d4-4957-81b9-130cabe9b0b9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"538d89f2-5489-4653-abbf-df182a50367b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"ZzyoDwGAry1QIN1bMupmlfxP/AUG18Uqj/DNOm2C39M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cb02e46d-2379-4a8f-8ee1-44db3a8c65c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"2n25BDHpMpFtSvBHYCzxmnl0+szAsbObMFEcDnKF8Ho="}},"text":"The global burden of worm infection prompted World Health Assembly resolutions to scale up interventions against NTDs.

The programme’s main goal is to eliminate worms as a public health problem for Kenyan children, both enrolled and non-enrolled, by treating at least six million children each year. Trained teachers provide treatment in both public and private schools across all areas endemic for parasitic worms, where children aged 2-14 have been dewormed annually since 2012. Prior to the start of the programme, treatment areas were selected according to globally recognized World Health Organization criteria. Deworming children regularly through schools is a proven, cost-effective, and safe treatment strategy that leverages the readily available and extensive infrastructure of education systems. WHO has certified the safety of teachers administering deworming tablets after simple training, and in Kenya this approach is both practical and highly efficient by leveraging the local health system. # Successes, challenges, & lessons learned\n\nOver its six years, the NSBD programme has achieved numerous successes and generated valuable lessons. These outcomes not only inform improvements in each additional year of implementation, but can also be applied to other health and education programmes. # Successes\n\n- In Year 6, the NSBD programme dewormed 6,360,900 children surpassing its annual target of 6 million. - Consistent and reliable funding allowed implementers to deliver the programme with confidence across all at-risk counties. - Intentional planning sessions with county and national decision-makers ensured that coinciding activities or holidays, such as Ramadhan, did not interfere with treatment. - A new database of hard-to-reach areas improved systematization and accuracy of budgeting and mitigated anticipated logistical challenges. - Technical officers from MOH, MOE, KEMSA, KEMRI, and Evidence Action met regularly in monthly Management Team meetings convened by NCAHU to plan, troubleshoot, and resolve implementation issues. - KEMSA played an active role in implementation, attending county meetings and helping to redistribute leftover drugs in the field in between treatment waves. - County and sub county teams submitted financial accountability documents in good time, accounting for 98% of all funds within five months of treatment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9l8kRu+kGGdfOBB2NK5c8H9/9gM9I15zA8y0TAkG5e0="},"fb1cdc07-f692-41eb-b931-d7873255126d":{"id_":"fb1cdc07-f692-41eb-b931-d7873255126d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6f812ff5-5568-4d29-8a22-906663714e6c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"9l8kRu+kGGdfOBB2NK5c8H9/9gM9I15zA8y0TAkG5e0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d44e2386-6f48-481d-ab72-529500c1c296","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"J1D9IiXlMo8oDJNUc5xZDV1uTO4NnGs9XimxXe8G1x0="}},"text":"- Partners’ collaboration, innovation, and commitment to success for the programme were showcased by efforts to advocate for, obtain, and redistribute drugs among sub counties for the impromptu third wave of treatment. # Challenges\n\n- To meet its targets, the programme had to implement a third wave due to insufficient drug supply at the time when waves one and two were undertaken, resulting in suboptimal resource coordination that overstretched the annual budget. - The Steering Committee was not convened on a quarterly basis as planned, but instead only met twice within the programme year, resulting in some missed opportunities for proactive strategic leadership, an example being the unresolved drug sourcing for year 6 and beyond. - At the sub county level, some school planning figures on Form P were inflated, which led to excess resource allocation.

Posters are put up in schools and strategic community locations to emphasize the importance of deworming, how to prevent infections, and the date and location of treatment. # 5 - Deworming Day\n\nOn designated county deworming days, teachers administer deworming tablets to children aged 2-14 years, including those enrolled in public and private primary schools, in nearby Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centres, and children from the community who are non-enrolled.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dXjNn9dVGf28v8I6eRvj6/XdX/QizakNJnI8PTbQDKk="},"4e77ce29-eeac-4d04-8441-30ad88636e58":{"id_":"4e77ce29-eeac-4d04-8441-30ad88636e58","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4fb04999-8edd-4f59-b820-9bb64e7e85e9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"dXjNn9dVGf28v8I6eRvj6/XdX/QizakNJnI8PTbQDKk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dbb7ff28-2dd9-4b5a-b8ff-01de6ff45bc7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"ysQ2X893pLp2dflFaaIlW8W6KINM5SiO+pABbokIkBk="}},"text":"Teachers fill in monitoring forms to record the number of children treated. MOH personnel visit schools to monitor drug administration and manage any adverse events. # 6 - Reverse Cascade\n\nAfter deworming day, head teachers send completed treatment forms to their ward / division level Curriculum Support Officers (CSOs), who compile and send the data to the SCDEs for sub county level summary. The SCDEs share the data with SCMOHs and respective county heads. Data forms and financial accountability documents are forwarded to the national level for data analysis and financial reconciliation. Any deworming medicine remaining at schools is taken to the CSOs along with summary data from each school. The CSOs forward this information to SCDEs, who forward to SCMOHs to fill tracking forms that indicate the number of unused medicines in the sub county. All remaining unopened tins of medicines are kept safely at sub county stores for the next round of deworming. For opened tins, the SCMOHs confirm quantities and redistribute the medicine to health facilities. The SCMOHs submit records to the national level indicating the amount of unused medicine, expiry dates, and where they have been redistributed. The reverse cascade is critical for the overall success of the programme, as it tracks the number of children treated and quantities of medicines used. # 8 National School-Based Deworming Programme

This process monitoring data highlights elements of the programme that are moving smoothly and in line with its evidence-based plans, as well as those which are not running as planned and may therefore be inefficient or ineffective. Findings are routinely shared with GoK implementers through reports and discussions about opportunities to improve the overall quality of NSBD. Process monitoring includes observation of sub county and teacher trainings, school preparedness, mass drug administration (MDA) procedures, and community sensitization, as well as interviews with children, government personnel, and parents in targeted areas. In Year 6, monitoring revealed that key training materials (booklets, posters, forms and tablet poles) were distributed in 81% of sub county trainings and 93% of teacher trainings. These trainings were also found to effectively transfer knowledge to implementers based on a quiz administered before and after training: before sub county trainings, participants correctly answered an average of 80% of questions related to STH, increasing to 100% after training. The same participants correctly answered 50% of questions related to schistosomiasis before training, and 98% after training. Similarly, teachers’ average scores for STH-related questions increased from 66% to 95%, and their scores for schistosomiasis increased from 45% to 90%. Community interviews prior to deworming day found that up to 96% of parents of enrolled children and 91% of parents of non-enrolled children planned to send their children for deworming. This suggests that the programme’s varied sensitization strategies were effective in creating awareness and mobilizing community members.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"x/YjiyfHiYMlIOipy1aL8WEIXDfrmSUk75ynV7/ni7I="},"73cac6ee-4051-43cb-9c33-8cd682d01b07":{"id_":"73cac6ee-4051-43cb-9c33-8cd682d01b07","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"09d05485-6294-4974-b923-b893e9e3b0e9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"x/YjiyfHiYMlIOipy1aL8WEIXDfrmSUk75ynV7/ni7I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d9b9daff-f3ad-4609-9d3a-de2a6a843725","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"PGItgP0qaziWwns3mTGYIivu6KJ69DUnrsOwGZ+xdLc="}},"text":"On Deworming Day, monitors observed MDA procedures and found that teachers administered the correct dosage of medicines, had sufficient recording forms and drugs available. # Coverage Validation\n\nCoverage validation was done within a week of the MDA in sampled counties, using WHO guidelines, to confirm that reported treatment figures were likely to be accurate. The coverage validation survey for STH indicated that 90% of targeted children were offered albendazole, and of these children, 78% swallowed the tablet based on validated reports compiled by head teachers. For schistosomiasis, the survey indicated that 85% of targeted children were offered praziquantel. Based on validated head teacher reports, 75% of children offered the drugs swallowed the tablets. With the validated reported coverage for both STH and schistosomiasis meeting the minimum recommended WHO threshold of 75%, partners can be confident that the Year 6 deworming exercise met its targets. # Impact Assessment: KEMRI\n\nThe Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) is the national body responsible for carrying out health research in Kenya, and is a key partner in the NSBD Programme. Through its renowned international experts in STH and schistosomiasis, KEMRI provides support in mapping, parasitological analysis, and impact evaluation. Results from this work guide programme decisions and help NSBD maintain its evidence-based approach. At the outset of NSBD in 2009, KEMRI scientists determined that the prevalence and intensity of STH in Western, Nyanza, Coast and parts of Rift Valley regions justified large-scale MDA. Each year, parasitological analyses have further informed decisions on programme targeting. For instance:\n\n- In Year 2, the programme added high-risk areas in Eastern, Central and North Eastern regions for schistosomiasis treatment due to results from parasitology surveys. - In Year 3, KEMRI conducted schistosomiasis mapping in North Eastern region to reconfirm BIU findings, ultimately reducing the number of targeted counties and schools to maintain an evidence-based treatment strategy. - In Year 6, through additional funding from Evidence Action, parasitological monitoring included both sites that had received routine monitoring for five years (i.e. 16 counties) as well as sites that had not been assessed since baseline (i.e.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cjNQg6kjmznWluefGF8hk4J3xYxMNccrwcA2j3qSero="},"d9b9daff-f3ad-4609-9d3a-de2a6a843725":{"id_":"d9b9daff-f3ad-4609-9d3a-de2a6a843725","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"73cac6ee-4051-43cb-9c33-8cd682d01b07","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"cjNQg6kjmznWluefGF8hk4J3xYxMNccrwcA2j3qSero="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"170864b3-154e-4391-ab5a-e3ef88b403ac","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"kQlwEZmO6wTifYr8H3T84mtVFh0Vm6us3dcdUecfZRc="}},"text":"16 counties) as well as sites that had not been assessed since baseline (i.e. 4 counties) to provide a programmatic assessment of the reductions in disease attributable to deworming, since each of these sites commenced in the NSBD. National School-Based Deworming Programme Year 6 report (2017-2018)\n---\n# Impact Assessment Strategy\n\nEach year since 2012, KEMRI’s Eastern and Southern Africa Centre of International Parasite Control (ESACIPAC) has conducted repeat cross-sectional school-level surveys assessing prevalence and intensity for three types of STH (hookworm, whipworm—specifically *Trichuris trichiura, and roundworm—specifically Ascaris lumbricoides) and schistosome infections (Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium*) in school-age children. These surveys provide a programmatic assessment of the impact of deworming over time. In Year 6, the surveys included 100 schools drawn from 20 counties (approximately 5 schools per county) in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, Coast, Eastern and North Eastern regions. Across these 100 schools, KEMRI analyzed stool samples of 9,801 children prior to deworming to determine prevalence and intensity of infection. In 40 schools in eight counties endemic for urinary schistosomiasis, urine samples were analysed to determine *Schistosoma haematobium* prevalence and intensity of infection. Strategic distribution of sampling sites allows surveys to establish an accurate measurement of infection across the NSBD program area. # Impact Monitoring Results\n\nThis section summarizes Year 6 evaluation results compared to the Year 1 baseline survey. The detailed report of KEMRI’s monitoring will be publicly available through a published paper. Table 1 summarizes the number of schools and children sampled per county, median age of children in school, and the school level prevalence range in each county. # Table 1: Number of schools and children examined by county, and school prevalence range (min - max), among school children in Kenya in Year 6\n\n|County|Schools (children)|Median age in years (min-max)|School range STH prevalence (min-max)|School range S. mansoni prevalence (min-max)|School range S.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PGItgP0qaziWwns3mTGYIivu6KJ69DUnrsOwGZ+xdLc="},"170864b3-154e-4391-ab5a-e3ef88b403ac":{"id_":"170864b3-154e-4391-ab5a-e3ef88b403ac","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d9b9daff-f3ad-4609-9d3a-de2a6a843725","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"PGItgP0qaziWwns3mTGYIivu6KJ69DUnrsOwGZ+xdLc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8a1dc4ba-6280-4023-90c1-e929ebd15bc6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"THqrjPaR5zxNecSfwWE5/imSYI6641g1DdW11Epi4Os="}},"text":"mansoni prevalence (min-max)|School range S. haematobium prevalence (min-max)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Bomet|5 (541)|10.0 (3-18)|13.0-39.80|-0|-|\n|Bungoma|5 (519)|9.5 (4-15)|0.9-9.30|-0|-|\n|Busia|5 (540)|11.0 (4-17)|0.9-56.50|-41.7-|-|\n|Garissa|5 (197)|10.0 (4-14)|0-00|-0|0-3.4|\n|Homa Bay|5 (535)|10.0 (5-15)|16.7-35.20|-15.3-|-|\n|Kakamega|5 (539)|10.0 (5-16)|17.6-38.90|-31.5-|-|\n|Kericho|5 (540)|9.0 (1-16)|13.0-22.20|-0|-|\n|Kisii|5 (532)|9.0 (4-16)|9.3-37.00|-0|-|\n|Kisumu|5 (540)|10.0 (5-16)|0-8.30|-13.9-|-|\n|Kitui|5 (540)|10.0 (2-18)|0-0.90|-2.8|0-0|\n|Kwale|5 (522)|9.0 (4-16)|0.9-11.10|-1.9|0-5.7|\n|Makueni|5 (522)|10.0 (4-14)|0-1.90|-13.90|-0|\n|Wajir|5 (112)|9.5 (3-14)|0-00|-0|0-0|\n|Migori|5 (539)|10.0 (4-19)|0.9-4.60|-0|-|\n|Mombasa|5 (526)|10.0 (4-16)|0-5.60|-0.9|0-0.9|\n|Narok|5 (516)|10.0 (4-21)|12.0-33.70|-0|-|\n|Nyamira|5 (511)|10.0 (3-14)|0-39.80|-0|-|\n|Taita Taveta|5 (491)|9.0 (3-15)|0-0.90|-0.9|0-0|\n|Vihiga|5 (532)|10.0 (1-14)|12.1-49.50|-1.9|-|\n|Total|00 (9,801)|10.0 (1-21)|0-56.50|-41.70|-5.7|\n\nTable 2 gives the overall prevalence, average intensity and relative reductions (RR) of the infections.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kQlwEZmO6wTifYr8H3T84mtVFh0Vm6us3dcdUecfZRc="},"8a1dc4ba-6280-4023-90c1-e929ebd15bc6":{"id_":"8a1dc4ba-6280-4023-90c1-e929ebd15bc6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"GrBn05J9tdL2VMRUeP0xz4j3XvofuPHb/9CfUCC7k0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"170864b3-154e-4391-ab5a-e3ef88b403ac","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"kQlwEZmO6wTifYr8H3T84mtVFh0Vm6us3dcdUecfZRc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"af297502-2e4c-4a6c-8ed2-b90728890991","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 6 Treatment Results Booklet_2018.pdf"},"hash":"b+ODx8EOuiYXjxN7yxiXEfTUEXodjOpE0gYyjgzHVcg="}},"text":"Overall prevalence of any STH was 12.9% at Year 6 compared to a Year 1 baseline of 33.6%.

Comprehensive and advance planning for programme activities is key\n2. Continuous engagement with requisite stakeholders is paramount to programme success\n3. Advocacy for policy direction and guidance by government should be continuous to mitigate gaps as a result of attrition, budgetary allocation and financial accountability\n4. Training, sensitization and distribution of inputs to key players for cascade implementation remains a pillar of success for the programme\n5. Availability of deworming medicine is the single most important driver for the implementation of the programme\n\nThe NSBD (National School-Based Deworming) programme is a government initiative implemented by the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health with technical support from Evidence Action. Over six million school-age children in Kenya are at risk of intestinal parasitic worm infection, including soil transmitted helminths and schistosomes, which have a negative impact on their health and education. The deworming programme aims to eliminate these worms as a public health problem in children aged 2-14 years (both enrolled and non-enrolled) in areas endemic for parasitic worms. When done regularly through schools it is cost effective and safe as trained teachers administer deworming tablets. Annual training sessions are critical to sustain relevant knowledge and skills for MDA: pre- and post-test scores showed that programme trainings increased sub county participants’ knowledge from 80% to 100% of required information for STH and from 50% to 98% for schistosomiasis; teachers’ average scores increased from 66% to 95% for STH and from 45% to 90% for schistosomiasis. Context-specific strategies for hard-to-reach areas enable proper planning and implementation; these can be further developed in future years to steadily increase coverage of underserved or marginalized population groups. Trainers should be encouraged to cover all prescribed topics thoroughly, as some important areas were only covered partially, such as filling in the treatment forms.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GHvq+EO3iFrSPoWrk3xO5q43pkZmK/tOACmHY0AOq+k="},"559675aa-f5b7-4fb9-a35d-18d77becf85d":{"id_":"559675aa-f5b7-4fb9-a35d-18d77becf85d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf"},"hash":"sporlO3A/dnDUVQZ3LWQnRikjJde13KkMjuhGsk2hek="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e9072351-fc3f-44fa-81ea-ef83d397b5ef","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf"},"hash":"GHvq+EO3iFrSPoWrk3xO5q43pkZmK/tOACmHY0AOq+k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"90d827e7-603d-4033-ab90-0d55f3e7b93e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 7 Treatment Results Booklet_2019.pdf"},"hash":"3cgy5RChavr0kPO+CXOXzdxefPBKRIVOpDjxXVgS3dA="}},"text":"Pending operational and costing analyses, NSBD may be able to adopt electronic data collection methods to halve the time taken to receive data from the field. # Coverage Map\n\n|Treated for STH and Schistosomiasis|Treated for STH Only|\n|---|---|\n|Bomet|Kisii|\n|Bungoma|Kisumu|\n|Busia|Kitui|\n|Garissa|Kwale|\n|Homa bay|Lamu|\n|Kakamega|Machakos|\n|Kericho|Makueni|\n|Kilifi|Migori|\n|Kirinyaga|Mombasa|\n|Wajir| |\n\n# National School Based Deworming Programme: Treatment Results 2018 - 2019\n---\n# NATIONAL SCHOOL-BASED DEWORMING PROGRAMME\n\n# Successes:\n\n- The Y7 programme implementation was successful against the odds of erratic supply of deworming medicines. - Over 90% data and financial returns across all implementing counties and sub-counties received\n- 23 county sensitization meetings held\n- 126 sub-county trainings conducted\n- 934 teacher training sessions conducted\n- 18,164 schools reached\n- 31,374 GoK officials trained\n- 126 Master Trainers trained and implemented training activities\n\n# Opportunities:\n\nThere is however is an opportunity for effective engagement at National and County levels to explore more sustainable options for sourcing of deworming medicines. One proposal is to have the Ministry of Health (MOH) at national level through the division of adolescent and school health (DASH) have budgetary allocation for purchase of deworming medicines for the programme. An alternate proposal at county level would be to have each county procure the same prior to scheduled deworming days. # Challenges:\n\nThe greatest challenge during the Y7 programme implementation was irregular supply of deworming medicines, which led to postponement of scheduled programme activities, warranting a third treatment wave. Further, postponement meant that there was an increased rate in reinfection and a high worm load in children.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IXv+QwUNqjcyc7ems0yTSE46yXkWQoLAXxTh7V9bhrk="},"90d827e7-603d-4033-ab90-0d55f3e7b93e":{"id_":"90d827e7-603d-4033-ab90-0d55f3e7b93e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis

Treatment Results\n\n# National School-Based Deworming Programme: Treatment Results 2019 - 2020\n\nPage 1\n---\n# Overview of the Programme\n\nThe National School-Based Deworming programme (NSBD) is a government initiative implemented by the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health with technical support from Evidence Action. Over six million school-age children in Kenya are at risk of intestinal parasitic worm infection, including soil transmitted helminths and schistosomes, which have a negative impact on their health and education. Treatment areas are selected according to globally recognized World Health Organization criteria. This programme is a national priority which aims at eliminating these worms as a public health problem in children aged 2-14 years (both enrolled and non-enrolled) in areas endemic with parasitic worms. If practiced regularly, it is proven to be cost effective and safe as trained teachers administer deworming tablets in our schools in 48 sub counties in 27 counties. Moreover, it forms a key part in the performance contracts for the Cabinet and Principal Secretaries of Education and Health. # Cascade Overview\n\nThe NSBD programme uses a cascade implementation model that efficiently and cost-effectively delivers training, deworming medicines, monitoring forms, funds and other programme materials and resources from the national level to schools. The cascade brings together personnel from the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health for collaborative leadership in planning, implementation, and monitoring of programme activities at all levels. # County Sensitisation and Planning meetings:\n\nCounty Directors of Education and Health convene sensitisation meetings on the programme. This allows the programme to gain buy-in and build partnerships with county level leaders. # Sub county Trainings:\n\nMaster trainers, nominated from the (MOE) and (MOH) personnel in implementing counties, are responsible for training of Sub county and ward / division level personnel on managing and implementing the programme. Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) / Community Health Assistants (CHAs) also attend this training to support in community mobilization and management of any potential serious adverse events (SAEs). # Teacher Trainings:\n\nTeachers are critical to the programme’s success. They help in the administration of deworming medicines in schools.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oyeA3iFc4SNeE1R0oTjUsmhnOq49RmGO/zvYgJxQUf4="},"550f6eac-2894-4df5-af75-e9abdf48d9ea":{"id_":"550f6eac-2894-4df5-af75-e9abdf48d9ea","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"hash":"a+nKzYJEGFh2TjLrI8FEbVUMrYvdpl/GmaAzjzI1wfM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"57d90da6-cbb5-493a-954a-bfa45faa6ab1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"hash":"oyeA3iFc4SNeE1R0oTjUsmhnOq49RmGO/zvYgJxQUf4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"14454bdf-3b89-416b-b3a1-7cc6c5f9f2e9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"hash":"La21+Mb64pb0eot+aW8dyZbklbjHY14XlX3u+cl7obA="}},"text":"They help in the administration of deworming medicines in schools. Head teachers and health teachers are trained to sensitize children and the community, administer deworming medicine and properly fill and submit reporting forms after deworming day. # Community Sensitisation and Mobilisation:\n\nBefore Deworming Day, health workers and teachers share key messages with children, parents, and local leaders, encouraging community members to bring their children for deworming. Posters are put up in schools and strategic community locations to emphasize the importance of deworming and how to prevent infections. Information is also disseminated through local FM radio stations. # Deworming Day:\n\nOn designated county Deworming Days, teachers administer deworming medicines to children aged 2-14 years in public and private primary schools, in Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centres, and to children from the community who are non-enrolled. Teachers fill out monitoring forms to record the number of children treated. MOH personnel visit schools to monitor drug administration and manage any serious adverse events that might occur.

(66%) of parents chose this as a preferred source of information to increase awareness and understanding of the Deworming Day and key messages especially among parents of non-enrolled children. - Ensure that the timing of community sensitization takes place early enough to encourage attendance on deworming day.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"La21+Mb64pb0eot+aW8dyZbklbjHY14XlX3u+cl7obA="},"13326e1d-5339-446d-a425-9e743b8db14d":{"id_":"13326e1d-5339-446d-a425-9e743b8db14d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"hash":"a+nKzYJEGFh2TjLrI8FEbVUMrYvdpl/GmaAzjzI1wfM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"14454bdf-3b89-416b-b3a1-7cc6c5f9f2e9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"hash":"La21+Mb64pb0eot+aW8dyZbklbjHY14XlX3u+cl7obA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9e66bafa-6373-4b8c-826b-c27fa9e45df2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 8 Treatment Results Booklet_2020.pdf"},"hash":"CcpXABs75nPDwRVrb+RaXuTXEtyaMeASChEtI/5WXZw="}},"text":"- Ramp up some key Deworming Day practices in future training such as:\n- Use and submission of reporting forms.

Similarly prevalence differed within counties with highest prevalence, during Y6, observed in Vihiga (30.8%) followed by Bomet (24.2%), Kakamega (23.8%), Busia (23.4%) and Narok (23.1%) and no infections detected in Garissa and Wajir counties. However, Kitui, Makueni and Taita had their prevalence below 1%. County level relative reduction indicated that only two counties; Bungoma and Migori, reduced the SAC prevalence by over 90%. Even though it was observed that the PSAC prevalence appeared to have reduced over the years, it was still high especially in many areas in Western parts of Kenya. Further, we noted that the treatment coverage during all the survey years was high (>75%). However, this high coverage did not clearly translate to low prevalence in the respective areas. Finally, the analysis of the minimum treatment coverage required to ensure a reduction of the infection prevalence over time for both age groups was done. It was observed that for program-wide reduction of undifferentiated STH in both PSAC and SAC, a likely minimum treatment coverage of 82% is required. Additionally, for each differentiated STH species, likely minimum treatment coverage of 85% for hookworm, 84% for A. lumbricoides, and 74% for T. trichiura is required to be maintained. In conclusion, the findings showed an initially higher burden of STH infections among both groups of children which declined steadily over the survey years. However, the programme should consider increasing the deworming coverage for PSAC, and also maintain a minimum treatment coverage threshold to ensure that prevalence will decline as coverage increases.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0hI/xrZmMug1SvaQJZc4A5IH/Xa9S/Q9Bfl6GlFIL0M="},"215a3a39-2ff0-4efe-85cd-8321f3b9871e":{"id_":"215a3a39-2ff0-4efe-85cd-8321f3b9871e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis

In 2012, the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education together set out to treat at least 5.5 million children per year for soil-transmitted helminths and have achieved beyond their target year after year. The programme maintains its goal of eliminating parasitic worm infection as a public health problem and is on its way to achieving the World Health Organisation’s 2030 disease targets as set within the WHO road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021−2030. # Parasitic worms\n\npose a serious threat to children’s long-term health, education, and productivity. In Kenya, over six million children aged 2-14 years are currently living in areas at risk of parasitic worm infection, including soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis, and require annual deworming treatment. Twenty-seven counties across Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Coast, North Eastern, Eastern, and Central regions are endemic for soil-transmitted helminthiasis, with 15 of the total 27 co-endemic for schistosomiasis. Treating children through schools provides the greatest opportunity to reach a high proportion of the at-risk population while minimizing costs using existing infrastructure. School-based deworming effectively reaches over 80% of the target population, children aged 2-14 regardless of school enrolment, in all at-risk geographies in the country. Trained and trusted primary school teachers administer deworming medicines annually.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bUURfmf0DNR95aUcsQTdeYM3PH4XGGTPbQK13iEnYSE="},"d840c306-7ed2-4dda-bbc3-43d9a8ccfc10":{"id_":"d840c306-7ed2-4dda-bbc3-43d9a8ccfc10","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"6sk6Efiv1kArpRqmi7qZIGymImY9Q5AdF79tTyiIkxs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0015125d-79e1-4e38-9e2e-c1d8767a085b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"bUURfmf0DNR95aUcsQTdeYM3PH4XGGTPbQK13iEnYSE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"18b89189-c6d5-46be-b0d9-6d9387c3973e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"Qvr9V3pGWj6cQFLFk4lQMEa3ZDVYeLi9a25rH0ncGnM="}},"text":"Trained and trusted primary school teachers administer deworming medicines annually.

Detailed planning and programme implementation is conducted at the county level with personnel from the two ministries playing a joint leadership role to ensure that the programme is implemented in every school within the targeted treatment areas. ---\n# National School Based Deworming Programme: Treatment Results 2020 / 2021\n\n# Impact of Deworming: New Evidence\n\nRigorous evidence shows that mass deworming is a cost-effective solution that transforms the lives of children over the short and long term. Deworming treatment leads to significant weight gains and allows more energy to be focused on child growth and development. A study in Uganda, for example, found that deworming treatment increased child weight by 10% for children who received treatment twice per year, and by 5% for children who received treatment annually. School-based mass deworming has also shown to reduce school absenteeism more cost-effectively than alternative ways of boosting school attendance. In Kenya, school-based mass deworming reduced school absenteeism by 25% for those in treatment schools. Furthermore, deworming has spill over effects for untreated school-age and preschool children. In Kenya, young siblings of those treated, as well as children who lived nearby treatment schools but were too young to be dewormed, showed gains in cognitive development equal to half a year of schooling when evaluated ten years later. The impact of deworming on children goes beyond health and education outcomes. A new landmark study published in 2021 by a team of economists, led by Edward Miguel and Nobel laureate Michael Kremer, offers new evidence of the long-term benefits of school-based deworming. According to the study, which followed a group of Kenyan students every 5 years over a 20-year period, receiving two to three additional years of deworming increased their income by 13% and consumption by 14% decades after treatment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bBvrtEXOfGWT+jVfysCn5LagPmHaY5UHASGPaqpq1ZY="},"18b89189-c6d5-46be-b0d9-6d9387c3973e":{"id_":"18b89189-c6d5-46be-b0d9-6d9387c3973e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"6sk6Efiv1kArpRqmi7qZIGymImY9Q5AdF79tTyiIkxs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d840c306-7ed2-4dda-bbc3-43d9a8ccfc10","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"bBvrtEXOfGWT+jVfysCn5LagPmHaY5UHASGPaqpq1ZY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e576b24e-ebf3-407d-b51a-b3e3a5a50e88","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"PyIorWjzJUO9/a10ZovfvzJKiTRKMzT1OddwJHyca0M="}},"text":"An extra two to three years of deworming treatments in school also significantly increased odds (by 9%) of working outside of agriculture and in urban areas, which presents more opportunity for jobs that largely pay better and offer more opportunity for growth.

Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) / Community Health Assistants (CHAs) also attend this training to support community mobilisation and management of any potential serious adverse events (SAEs). # Teacher Trainings\n\nTeachers are critical to the programme’s success as they administer deworming medicines in schools. Head teachers and health teachers are trained to sensitise children and the community, administer deworming medicines, and properly fill and submit reporting forms after Deworming Day. # Community Sensitisation and Mobilisation\n\nBefore Deworming Day, health workers and teachers share key messages with children, parents, and local leaders, encouraging community members to bring their children for deworming. Posters are put up in schools and in strategic community locations to emphasise the importance of deworming, how to prevent infections, and the date and location of treatment. The key messages are also disseminated through local radio stations. # Deworming Day\n\nOn designated County Deworming Days, teachers administer deworming medicines to children aged 2-14 years in public and private primary schools, in nearby Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres, and to children from the community who are out-of-school. Teachers complete treatment forms to record the number of children treated.

Results from this work guide programme decisions, demonstrate the impact of the programme, and help the National School-Based Deworming Programme maintain its evidence-based approach. Following four successful large-scale surveys of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis, in Year 9 of the programme, KEMRI conducted an in-depth secondary analysis using previous survey data (Y1-Y6). The studies were designed to; observe trends in prevalence and intensity across the lifespan of the programme, differentiate prevalence between PSAC and SAC, identify correlations between changes in treatment coverage and STH infection, identify WASH and behaviour correlates with helminth infection, and observe correlations with country-level and risk of infection. Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and S. haematobium have experienced substantial reductions in prevalence over the course of the programme while S. mansoni has remained low. Prevalence surveys have been conducted at baseline (2012), midline (2015), endline (2017), and follow-up (2018) estimating the overall prevalence of any STH to shift from 33.6%, 18.6%, 15.2%, and to 12.9% over the course of the programme. S. haematobium has been estimated at 18.0%, 7.9%, 3.9%, and 0.3% while S. mansoni 2.4%, 1.7%, 2.0% and 0.2% over the same time periods. After six rounds of MDA, prevalence of STH has significantly declined among both PSAC and SAC, however prevalence of moderate and heavy intensity infections for both classes of parasite are yet to decrease below 2%, the point at which they are no longer considered a public health problem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7cmDTI545fgSLS1WLlsSKUJzVdpThu6fq0pQOhttrbs="},"f5a31e6d-9c39-4d20-ba84-7f2679486239":{"id_":"f5a31e6d-9c39-4d20-ba84-7f2679486239","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"6sk6Efiv1kArpRqmi7qZIGymImY9Q5AdF79tTyiIkxs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2068a4e0-4bcb-4d35-8b90-cddc08202530","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"7cmDTI545fgSLS1WLlsSKUJzVdpThu6fq0pQOhttrbs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"32755856-c531-4194-bdc9-b69c1de47cc0","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NSBD Year 9 Treatment Results Booklet_2021.pdf"},"hash":"FrdphWT6aJbFbjXRRxYTJmYxzL00pxMxkJFF8cK5D8Q="}},"text":"The programme has been highly effective, contributing to a reduction of 60.0% in the total number of people infected with any STH and of 97.9% for S. haematobium.

Note that Year 1 was not displayed since there was no previous year treatment coverage to compare with the baseline prevalence. Finally significant correlates with risk of STH infection have been shown to include not wearing shoes, [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.36 (95%CI: 1.09–1.69); p = 0.007]; high number of household members [aOR = 1.21 (95%CI: 1.04–1.41); p = 0.015]; and school absenteeism of more than two days [aOR = 1.33 (95%CI: 1.01–1.80); p = 0.045].

Once challenges are identified, programmatic changes can be made to strengthen inputs prior to the following round of deworming for higher quality outputs. Process monitoring also helps to address challenges in real-time.

The National School-Based Deworming Programme contracts an independent monitoring firm to conduct\n---\n# National School Based Deworming Programme: Treatment Results 2020 / 2021\n\nBoth process monitoring and coverage validation surveys before, during, and after deworming.

There was also a shift away from WHO donation to full drug procurement through KEMSA and increased national inter-ministerial coordination with NTD partners. # Lessons Learned & Way Forward\n\nThere is a need to procure Praziquantel for SCH treatment moving forward to ensure that children do not miss out on treatment in any given year. There should also be more focus on increasing access to treatment of out-of-school children and pre-school age children as well as accessing hard to reach areas. Consideration should likewise be made toward a mixed platform approach i.e school-based and community-based deworming with continued coordination among partners. There is also a need to work towards better reporting systems, data management and programme ownership. ---\n# National School Based Deworming Programme: Treatment Results 2020 / 2021\n\n# Deworm the world Initiative","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OZlyVUklGQv9BxoHB0L1UVNDIYVdb72neQqXdcxYk2w="},"fa2c7eba-603d-465f-ae7e-8b4750d85de5":{"id_":"fa2c7eba-603d-465f-ae7e-8b4750d85de5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"367f8405-e0cc-4973-93a2-f0001d9ee311","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"ZQAeef57OmeaWvaLcXHWb0MXtkTUZlFcalGTHjRQ9ew="}},"text":"# Kenya National Master Plan for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases\n\n# NTD: DAY 30\n\n# 2023 = 2027\n\n# Towards a Healthy and Productive Nation Free from NTDs\n---\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\n---\n# Kenya National Master Plan for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases, 2023 - 2027\n\n# Developed by the Division of Vector Borne and Neglected Tropical Diseases - Ministry of Health\n\nCopyright 2022 Ministry of Health\n\nAny part of this document may be freely reviewed, quoted, reproduced or translated in full or in part so long as the source is acknowledged.

During this period, the Government of Kenya provided exemplary leadership and support for the programme that led to certification of elimination of Guinea Worm Disease by WHO in 2018 and preparation of a draft dossier for certification of elimination of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) as a public health problem. Kenya remains on track to interrupt transmission of onchocerciasis and eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, Trachoma, and Schistosomiasis, Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH) as public health problems. However, despite this remarkable success, much remains to be done to reduce the overall burden of NTDS in Kenya. The Ministry of Health is pleased to present this NTD Master Plan 2023 – 2027 to guide a multi-sectoral collaborative effort to make Kenya a healthy and productive nation free from NTDs. The Master Plan builds on past lessons and experiences as reference to accelerate our efforts and address emerging challenges. The Master Plan is aligned with the following documents: 2010 Constitution of Kenya, in particular Article 43 which guarantees the highest attainable standard of health, including the right to healthcare service, the Kenya Health Policy 2014 – 2030, and the WHO Road Map for Neglected Tropical Diseases 2021–2030. In the next five years, Kenya will move from a disease-specific to integrated interventions approach that optimizes the use of resources and reduces duplication of effort. The Ministry of Health calls upon the county governments, donors, partners, communities, and individuals to work together to control and eliminate NTDS that are endemic in different parts of Kenya. The Master Plan has identified the key strategies, interventions, targets, roles and responsibilities of different actors to support a coordinated and effective approach to prevention, control, and elimination of NTDS. To promote country ownership and leadership, the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with partners, will support the development and deployment of new tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of NTDs and appeals to county governments to invest in the elimination and control of NTDS that are endemic in their counties.

Wafula\n\nCabinet Secretary,\n\nMinistry of Health\n\n# KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are diseases that cause human suffering, devastating social and economic burden among the poor and marginalized people in our country. NTDs are a diverse group of diseases that include bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal, and noncommunicable conditions. Despite the health and economic burden they cause on disadvantaged communities, there are tools and effective interventions for control and elimination of NTDs. Globally, as of 2020, there were 42 countries, territories and areas that have eliminated at least one NTD. Kenya has successfully implemented two previous NTD Master plans (2011 - 2015 and 2016 - 2020), leading to elimination of Guinea Worm Disease and interrupting transmission of Onchocerciasis and Human African Trypanosomiasis. The development of the 3rd NTD Master Plan (2023 – 2027) is part of Government’s efforts to build on the progress made so far, utilize lessons learned to address current challenges and commit to new NTD elimination targets. The Ministry of Health and partners have adopted the vision of A healthy and productive nation free from NTDs for this Master Plan. This will be achieved by the stated mission of accelerating the prevention, control, elimination, and eradication of targeted NTDs in Kenya. Key achievements during the implementation of this Master Plan are certification of elimination (interruption of transmission) of Onchocerciasis and Human African Trypanosomiasis by 2025 and elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis, Trachoma, Rabies, Soil Transmitted Helminths and Schistosomiasis as public health problems by 2027.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"36NjX1TLpNKc4xlctpJ++1qC4wFKd0TOeyOIhnbCRgQ="},"95d74d1e-7fb7-46d2-8eef-811c494a68c6":{"id_":"95d74d1e-7fb7-46d2-8eef-811c494a68c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bae53d60-5955-46fe-8599-eb185574fd1c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"36NjX1TLpNKc4xlctpJ++1qC4wFKd0TOeyOIhnbCRgQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"38786a96-51c5-4fbd-affd-fd3c1a0c4b38","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"1mFPxsqxN2daJH+D257WQTBBiO25XV2AcNWvG01kwPU="}},"text":"The NTD Master Plan 2023 – 2027 is a comprehensive multi-year plan which provides strategic direction and guidance to all partners in the health and related sectors (education, agriculture, water, and sanitation) on the control, and elimination and eventual eradication of all NTDs that are relevant in Kenya. It will also be used as a management and coordination tool by the Ministry of Health, counties, and partners to support one another and hold each other accountable. The Master Plan is well aligned to the Kenya Health Policy 2014 – 2030, the 2012 London Declaration on NTDs, WHO Ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals – A road map for Neglected Tropical Diseases 2021 – 2030. The development of the NTD Master Plan 2023-2027 was a culmination of various initiatives including meetings, workshops to comprehensively review the 2nd Kenya National Strategic Plan for Control of NTD 2016-2020 to document successes, lessons learned and challenges and develop content for the new Master Plan. This was achieved through desk review of NTD documents and reports, convening review meetings with NTD focal points and convening workshops with key stakeholders, including donors, implementing partners and focus counties. For Kenya to be successful in accelerating progress towards prevention, control, elimination, and eradication of NTDs, four strategic pillars were identified. These strategic pillars are key focus areas for the NTD programme to intensify action against NTDs. These include, To,\n\n1. accelerate programmatic action\n2. intensify cross-cutting approaches\n3. enhance resource mobilization, advocacy, and sustainability, and\n4. strengthen leadership, capacity, communication, and collaboration for the elimination of NTDs. Overall, the NTD Master Plan 2023 – 2027 places emphasis on the following:\n\n- Scaling up prevention, control, and elimination of neglected tropical diseases prevalent in Kenya,\n- Outlining specific, measurable targets up to 2027 for the eradication, elimination, and control of all NTDs endemic in Kenya,\n- Providing the basis for integration or linkage of NTD activities by GOK, partners, and counties.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3Km1YVydiYMkW8764mKAg5DWFzFxPymXa6vNSfHOlqQ="},"38786a96-51c5-4fbd-affd-fd3c1a0c4b38":{"id_":"38786a96-51c5-4fbd-affd-fd3c1a0c4b38","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"95d74d1e-7fb7-46d2-8eef-811c494a68c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"3Km1YVydiYMkW8764mKAg5DWFzFxPymXa6vNSfHOlqQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3d99295c-ea82-4990-aa5b-3dbab13ff2aa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"LKs2tVuiGjIwYSArBFAAyYwkxsTEhkLxirNOuNP63LY="}},"text":"KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\n# KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n\n• Engage and empower individuals and communities to play an active role in prevention and treatment of NTDs,\n\n• Provide a forum for the media, private sector, and the academia to contribute to the NTD elimination agenda,\n\n• Provide a coordination mechanism with other sectors such as WASH, Agriculture, Education, etc. to play a key role in NTD elimination. # The National NTD Master Plan is organized into four main parts:\n\n# Part I – Situation Analysis\n\nThis includes the country context, health system situation analysis and the NTD situational analysis. # Part II – Strategic Agenda – Purposes and Goal\n\nThis articulates the NTD programme mission, vision, guiding principles and the strategic pillars, priorities, and initiatives. # Part III – Operational Framework\n\nThis outlines the framework for implementing the strategic plan. # Part IV – Budget\n\nThe implementation of this Master Plan is critical and will involve all stakeholders – several government ministries, various divisions of the Ministry of Health, county governments, other sectors (education, agriculture, WASH, etc.), donors, implementing partners, NTD clients, communities, civil society groups, academia, media, and the private sector.

Despite their diversity, NTDs share a common geographical and social context: their burden is predominantly located in tropical areas across the globe, and they mainly affect resource poor communities.1 The African Region bears close to 40% of the global burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). All the 47 countries in the African Region are endemic for at least one NTD, and 36 of them (78%) are co-endemic for at least five of these diseases. By impairing the physical and intellectual capacities of the affected persons and because they thrive in areas where access to quality healthcare, clean water and sanitation is limited, NTDs perpetuate a cycle of poverty. Three out of six countries in sub-Saharan Africa with the highest NTD prevalence have an ongoing violent conflict.2 This holds for the Central African Republic (CAR), endemic for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), South Sudan for visceral leishmaniasis and leprosy, and Ethiopia for trachoma.3 In 2022, and in order of their league table ranking in fighting NTDs, Burundi, Mali, Burkina Faso, Somalia, Rwanda, Togo, Mauritania, Benin and Malawi all reached the 75% average target.4 Impressive strides have been made in Sub-Saharan Africa countries with Togo eliminating lymphatic filariasis in 2017 as a public health problem, and Ghana eliminating trachoma in May 2018.5 In 2022, the WHO certified Malawi to have eliminated Lymphatic filariasis and trachoma as public health problems.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JyJD0FNqit6tmA/alioEHe9KpUK+dyrepulp43UNKVQ="},"87a5de96-ce79-4be4-8261-0d3e9ae2de21":{"id_":"87a5de96-ce79-4be4-8261-0d3e9ae2de21","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"358327c6-364c-4bd2-86b1-27aab81bbfa6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"JyJD0FNqit6tmA/alioEHe9KpUK+dyrepulp43UNKVQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"390ed95a-10b6-4639-8453-95843045bd87","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"NBFzt15vKYc6CKfrQs5YPYCDsmf7cewVV8KgvSIdmuc="}},"text":"In Kenya, 18 out of the 20 NTDs listed by the WHO are suspected, confirmed, or endemic to the country.6 In February 2018, Kenya became the 41st country out of the 47 Member States in the African Region to be certified free of Guinea worm disease while Leprosy is being eliminated as a public health problem, and Human African Trypanosomiasis is moving steadily towards elimination.5\n\nThe NTD programme contributes to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 3.3 and 3.8) i.e., SDG 3.3: end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and NTDs and SDG 3.8: achieve universal health coverage, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. This is also supported by several declarations including: the Addis Ababa NTD Commitment (2014) by African health ministers to “work to increase our domestic contribution to the implementation of NTD programs”; ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals; WHO road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030 and the 2012 London Declaration on NTDs. Prior to development of the new Kenya NTD Master Plan, the Ministry of Health (MOH) Division of Vector Borne and Neglected Tropical Diseases (DVBNTD), in collaboration with WHO and key stakeholders, conducted a review of implementation of the previous Master Plan. The goal was to conduct a comprehensive review of the 2nd Kenya National Strategic Plan for control of Neglected Tropical Diseases 2016-2020 to determine and document successes, lessons learned and challenges. This was achieved through desk review of NTD documents and quarterly and annual reports; convening review meetings with NTD focal points; and convening review meetings with key stakeholders, including donors, implementing partners and focus counties. Comprehensive multi-year plans for the control, and elimination and eventual eradication of all NTDs that are relevant in the country, known as NTD Programme Master Plans, are essential strategic documents for governments to effectively plan and implement sustainable NTD programmes in the African region. Each national NTD programme’s comprehensive multi-year plan (the NTD Master plan) provides programme goals, objectives and year strategy based on extensive situation analysis, and addresses all components of the NTD programmes relevant to the country.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7dtw4uOJKeSTVQcaHl5kQGpdBbj3g85wU9gfasPrDjc="},"390ed95a-10b6-4639-8453-95843045bd87":{"id_":"390ed95a-10b6-4639-8453-95843045bd87","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"87a5de96-ce79-4be4-8261-0d3e9ae2de21","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"7dtw4uOJKeSTVQcaHl5kQGpdBbj3g85wU9gfasPrDjc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"de31e42c-3dc3-4c25-976b-2be45b0d815f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"DcMW47maMrJZ11MkSTkTysjQexLXnlxEYTHY7zrKRbU="}},"text":"It enhances synergies among various NTD initiatives, provides the basis for integrated. 1 WHO Publication\n\n2 GPI GP.

Introduction\n\nThe proposed NTD Master Plan (2023-2027) governs the prevention, control and, where feasible, elimination and eradication of neglected tropical diseases. It aligns with the WHO NTD Roadmap ‘Ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals - A road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030. The aim of the Master Plan is to be a tool for the government to plan for all NTD programmes in the country and facilitate alignment among partners and stakeholders for a joint and complementary support to counties and to accelerate progress towards the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of all relevant NTDs in the country. # 2. Objectives\n\nThe Master Plan outlines specific, measurable targets up to 2027 for the control, elimination and eradication of all NTDs endemic in the country, as well as cross-cutting targets aligned with WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019-2023, and the SDGs. It includes the strategies and approaches for achieving these targets, with cross-cutting themes for several diseases. # 3. Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nProgress in implementing planned activities as well as the programme performance and outputs will be monitored regularly and evaluated at appropriate intervals by the ministry of Health (DVBNTD).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NBFzt15vKYc6CKfrQs5YPYCDsmf7cewVV8KgvSIdmuc="},"de31e42c-3dc3-4c25-976b-2be45b0d815f":{"id_":"de31e42c-3dc3-4c25-976b-2be45b0d815f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"390ed95a-10b6-4639-8453-95843045bd87","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"NBFzt15vKYc6CKfrQs5YPYCDsmf7cewVV8KgvSIdmuc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"775d09f7-32e6-495c-9531-25547895442a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"Bt6watXyGLrOE2A2pnRv9Vfc0zxrXsZG9Z6/sE7x0uE="}},"text":"The master plan will be the framework for coordination, harmonization, and alignment of both central and sub-national governments, as well as partners.

Twenty households are placed under a Community Health Volunteer (CHV), who is in turn supervised by a Community Health Assistant (CHA), such that one CHA has between 10-20 CHVs under their supervision. The Community Health Units (CHUs) so formed will be linked to the Tier 2 (Primary care) facility within whose catchment area they fall, by the CHA who is a trained health worker. Where CHUs are not yet activated/functional, villages will be used as units of service delivery. Village Health Committees (VHCs) will be formed to serve the purpose.

This has remained constant over the last decade. However, health expenditures as a proportion of GDP increased from 5.1% to 5.4% while public expenditures as a proportion of general government expenditures have been reduced from 8.0% to 4.6% during the same period. The health sector continues to be predominantly financed by private sector sources (including by households’ out-of-pocket (OOP) spending). The private sector share of total health expenditure has decreased from a high of 54 per cent in 2001/02 (of which 44.8% constitutes OOP expenditure) to 37 per cent in 2009/10, (of which 24% constitutes OOP expenditure). This decrease in OOP was primarily driven by increases in government and donor resources. Public sector financing has also remained constant over the last decade, at about 29 per cent of total health expenditure, whereas donors’ contribution has more than doubled, from 16 per cent in 2001/02 to 35 per cent in 2009/2013. # 1.2.3 Health Workforce\n\nFor effective delivery of healthcare services, Kenya requires adequate, productive, motivated, and equitably distributed pool of health workers. The number of healthcare personnel has increased over the years to peak at an average of 20.7 doctors and 159.3 nurses for every 100,000 persons by 2013. However, this is below the WHO-recommended average of 21.7 doctors and 228 nurses per 100,000 people. There is also a skewed urban-rural distribution of staff, with the urban areas having the highest proportions of staff at the expense of rural and remote areas where 70% of the population lives. The main reasons for the skewed distribution are 1) insufficient resources, 2) poor human resources planning and management practices and structures, and 3) unsatisfactory working conditions. The Government of Kenya has established the Integrated Human Resource Information System (iHRIS) that captures all data for public health workers at both national and county level.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"n1M9aoC/RC9H+U6DF+7CVNSpGvjv70KDea4lc89iYVs="},"3a23ba3e-f7d0-4552-ad84-1bce3d702d9c":{"id_":"3a23ba3e-f7d0-4552-ad84-1bce3d702d9c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"febc4e8b-e6f0-4865-9f87-b536e5cc37cf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"n1M9aoC/RC9H+U6DF+7CVNSpGvjv70KDea4lc89iYVs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a80cdba0-bbeb-41c5-b32f-5cad34ab3ac2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"T4wHrUN4BwWvUcWJ7NjCaHpjCzaDzDAaXU+SPDL1LrY="}},"text":"16 Ministry of Health, Kenya.

Each level of government has distinct responsibilities as assigned by the constitution. The national government provides leadership of health policy development; management of national referral health facilities; capacity building and technical assistance to counties; and consumer protection, including the development of norms, standards, and guidelines. County governments are responsible for county health services, including county health facilities and pharmacies; ambulance services; promotion of primary healthcare; licensing and control of undertakings that sell food to the public; cemeteries, funeral parlours and crematoria; and refuse removal, refuse dumps, and solid waste disposal. The Cabinet Secretary (CS) is the head of the Ministry of Health (MOH). He or she is responsible to the president for the exercise of the power and performance of ministerial functions. The Principal Secretary (PS) is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the ministry. The Director General of Health (DG Health) is the Head of Technical Services and Technical Advisor to the Cabinet Secretary (CS). The NTD Programme falls under the Department of Disease Surveillance and Response, which in turn falls under the Directorate of Public Health. # 1.2.5 Health Information\n\nThe Health Management Information System (HMIS) department in the MOH receives routine data on the causes of outpatient and in-patient morbidity and mortality from government health facilities across the country. Data for Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH), Schistosomiasis (SCH), Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) and Leprosy is captured at the peripheral facilities level. However, some of the NTDs including Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), Cystic Echinococcosis (CE), Taeniasis, Foodborne Trematode (FBT) and Onchocerciasis are not incorporated in the health facility register and in the HMIS.

Due to the high focality of SCH transmission, administrative unit below the sub-District (currently Wards in Kenya) may be considered in certain circumstances. However, due to financial resources constraints, not every Ward in a sub-District can be mapped independently. The mapping design combines several sub-Districts into mapping units, where transmission is likely to be similar, according to ecological factors affecting SCH transmission. This may lead to uncertainties if the site selection and sample size calculations are not properly undertaken. The program conducts granular mapping to address this challenge. ‘Granular mapping’ in this context is defined as conducting sampling at a much finer geographical resolution, examining a higher number of purposively selected schools or villages within lower-level administrative units (Wards) below each implementation unit (currently sub-County) to address the variability in prevalence attributable to the focal nature of SCH. Up to date, Granular mapping has been conducted in the Coast (2020) and Western regions (2021). See below maps that demonstrate the variance of endemicity of SCH in the same district after granular mapping (at ward level).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8NW7XXqgd5JcxLdU+si1BXWMpJtu95e1N0hYLamqKIM="},"8ba24229-3252-4efb-a8ac-9b5434f3d361":{"id_":"8ba24229-3252-4efb-a8ac-9b5434f3d361","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dfc58dd5-07c5-4e93-9b5d-4382824cc433","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"8NW7XXqgd5JcxLdU+si1BXWMpJtu95e1N0hYLamqKIM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c88cde1e-f858-4249-a092-e41c89bfbe4a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"oD0+ZU+ZYjhzoVd47kY21VBcWeQmLt1zt6x/4pmPMsU="}},"text":"26 KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\n# Figure 4: Prevalence of Schistosomiasis among Coastal Counties (Kwale, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Mombasa, Lamu, and Tana River) in 2020\n\nWard prevalence (%)0%(0% - 10%][10% - 50%]Not mapped\n\n# Figure 5: Endemicity of Schistosomiasis at ward level after precision mapping in Western region (Kakamega, Trans Nzoia, Vihiga, Bungoma) in 2021\n\n|SOI Prevalence (%)|0.0 - 9.9|10.0 - 19.9|20.0 - 34.0|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Oxqua|0.1 - 1.9|2.0 - 3.0| |\n|Chepdroina|2.0 - 9.9| | |\n|Kwanza| | | |\n|Idutho South| | | |\n|Katumbei| | | |\n|Kaponti| | | |\n|LAEI| | | |\n|Enfebess| | | |\n|Cheramanyl Suiverwa| | | |\n|Cental Bne| | | |\n|Koplarral| | | |\n|Saboj| | | |\n|Kolos %| | | |\n|Waita| | | |\n|Madiela| | | |\n|Snoko| | | |\n|Sktertu| | | |\n\n# KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\n# 1.3.3.1 Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Measures\n\nThe WHO has recommended preventive chemotherapy as a strategy for morbidity control that will help lessen the occurrence, extent, and severity of the consequences of infection.

However, surveys conducted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) indicate that these gains are easily eroded soon after the treatment. As such, there is need to expand treatment to other populations who live within the endemic regions but miss out on treatment especially the vulnerable groups including adults and non-enrolled children.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"x4sc85qwV4ZXt6ohFF+XGnRt1PxZETiYBPAc2Tlb7KQ="},"4964c425-735c-46ad-b6a4-d26f952ab714":{"id_":"4964c425-735c-46ad-b6a4-d26f952ab714","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"afdd2b78-0723-41cb-ab5e-736657cc763d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"x4sc85qwV4ZXt6ohFF+XGnRt1PxZETiYBPAc2Tlb7KQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7c17efe0-5b4e-42e4-bbc8-6bd286101f6d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"yYwiiHvEd47goyrkW9r9h4NVgAe/4i0Ly61EDDsqoHk="}},"text":"# Table 6: Overall Adult and School-aged Children Treated For STH\n\n|County|Oct – 2017|Nov – 2018|Jan – 2020|Sep – 2020|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Bomet|263,731|265,736|238,781|249,497|\n|Bungoma|505,942|524,388|510,536|-|\n|Busia|275,116|272,292|255,297|268,007|\n|Homa Bay|331,803|342,451|310,960|-|\n|Kakamega|585,871|603,352|580,414|-|\n|Kericho|262,895|261,058|250,333|241,795|\n|Kilifi|308,991|340,360|351,354|-|\n|Kisii|382,441|385,495|353,940|384,012|\n|Kisumu|275,282|290,101|284,069|300,481|\n|Kwale|-|194,413|187,947|-|\n|Lamu|26,677|32,121|31,056|-|\n|Migori|348,914|369,708|356,613|-|\n|Mombasa|179,931|209,786|195,270|-|\n|Nandi|124,058|112,377|109,364|108,707|\n|Narok|101,626|102,824|94,046|106,425|\n|Nyamira|175,240|174,639|162,057|167,168|\n|Siaya|263,131|266,357|256,768|273,574|\n|Taita Taveta|73,131|75,406|73,371|-|\n|Tana River|54,311|58,975|56,093|-|\n|Trans Nzoia|289,502|285,155|288,320|300,428|\n|Vihiga|179,190|154,047|178,952|184,077|\n|Garissa|792|9,810|698|-|\n|Kirinyaga|43,983|46,220|46,190|-|\n|Kitui|237|1,295|170|357|\n|Machakos|199|4,700|-|2,832|\n---\n# Overall Adult and SAC Treated\n\n|County|Oct – 2017|Nov – 2018|Jan – 2020|Sep – 2020|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Makueni|397|5,924|411|2,388|\n|Wajir|412|6,820|269|-|\n|Total|5,053,803|5,395,810|5,173,279|2,589,748|\n\n# 1.3.4.3 Community based deworming\n\nConsequently, since 2019, the Program has provided treatment using community-based approach in Homabay, Migori, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Kwale, Kilifi, Mombasa, Lamu, Bungoma, Kakamega, Trans Nzoia and Vihiga counties.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pam5Nisl+/fV36htQaL3Kf6MCDaIcMo4eh8ElqGk9oc="},"7c17efe0-5b4e-42e4-bbc8-6bd286101f6d":{"id_":"7c17efe0-5b4e-42e4-bbc8-6bd286101f6d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4964c425-735c-46ad-b6a4-d26f952ab714","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"pam5Nisl+/fV36htQaL3Kf6MCDaIcMo4eh8ElqGk9oc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"22acbb13-1b1f-4fef-b873-bb063de642e1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"YX7quhIl19IPu99YWoB+qfi82xM0zjPxixHBrIc6uos="}},"text":"The results of these MDA rounds are summarized below. #

However, at national level, WASH provision is separate from NTD control implying that better coordination and collaboration coupled with NTD guidance to the WASH sector are required to inform planning, resourcing, and targeting services in endemic areas. The need to focus on multiple interventions is further justified by the recognition that long-term solutions to STH require improvements in WASH. Multisectoral meetings with stakeholders including county officers and support to Water and Environmental Sanitation Coordination (WESCOOD) are important in coordinating control strategies for STH. # 1.3.6 Health Education\n\nHealth education forums are important in increasing awareness and knowledge on STH.

Adult worms’ nest in the lymphatic vessels disrupts the normal function of the lymphatic system. The worms can live for approximately 6–8 years and produce millions of microfilariae (immature larvae) that circulate in the blood. Mosquitoes are infected with microfilariae by ingesting blood when biting an infected host. Microfilariae mature into infective larvae within the mosquito. When infected mosquitoes bite people, mature parasite larvae are deposited in the skin and migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms, thus continuing the cycle of transmission. Lymphatic filariasis is transmitted by different types of mosquitoes i.e. Culex mosquito, widespread across urban and semi-urban areas, Anopheles, mainly found in rural areas, and Aedes, mainly in endemic islands in the Pacific. # 1.3.8.1 Symptoms\n\nLF infection involves asymptomatic, acute, and chronic conditions. Majority of infections are asymptomatic, showing no external signs of infection while contributing to transmission of the parasite. These asymptomatic infections cause damage to the lymphatic system, the kidneys and alter the body’s immune system. Acute episodes involve local inflammation of skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels and often accompanied by chronic lymphoedema or elephantiasis. Some of these episodes are caused by the body’s immune response to the parasite and secondary bacterial skin infection where normal defenses have been partially lost due to underlying lymphatic damage. These acute attacks are debilitating and may last for weeks and are the primary cause of lost wages among people with LF. 36 KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\n# Chronic Conditions from LF\n\nWhen LF develops into chronic conditions, it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). Involvement of breasts and genital organs is also common.

However, it is important to note that the national malaria control programme has been indirectly contributing to LF control and elimination through distribution of long-lasting insecticidal treated nets (LLINs). Previous research revealed that LLINs might have stopped resurgence of the disease when MDA was discontinued (Njenga et al., 2011). # 1.3.9 Trachoma\n\nTrachoma is an infectious blinding disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The disease is prevalent in dry areas with poor hygiene. The active disease occurs in children and potentially blinding disease in adults. The recommended monitoring indicators for active trachoma is trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years while the indicator for potentially blinding trachoma is trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in adults aged 15 years and above. MOH reports indicate that by 2020, Kenya had about 11 million people living in 12 trachoma endemic counties of Baringo, West Pokot, Turkana, Narok, Kajiado, Samburu, Laikipia, Marsabit, Meru, Embu, Isiolo and Kitui. An estimated 53,200 have already been blinded by the disease. Initial trachoma surveys in Kenya were conducted in administrative districts. In 2010 administrative districts were replaced with administrative counties. From 2010 to date, trachoma surveys are conducted in the WHO recommended implementation units (IUs) with population of between 100,000 and 250,000 people each. Counties are sub-divided to create the IUs. Trachoma impact surveys have been conducted after every 1 to 5 years of project implementation depending on the endemicity of active trachoma (TF) as guided in the decision-making diagram for Trachoma MDA in figure 15. Surveillance surveys are conducted after 24 months after elimination of TF as a public health problem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Dbfk/IZA75f/3Yzy4m9R4OHAcPEMV3ABayXpeW3lmtY="},"0f8ce8e3-3d46-4e89-9ebc-48556bc11605":{"id_":"0f8ce8e3-3d46-4e89-9ebc-48556bc11605","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bea915c7-288a-466a-b5e4-f62918f9aa8d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"Dbfk/IZA75f/3Yzy4m9R4OHAcPEMV3ABayXpeW3lmtY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0e24de35-e494-4b2e-9fc6-98e4c85bcca7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"9jxhhIVfLJc4xpltiIuXA/mAtNGLbCgeuJVTjPTuwOQ="}},"text":"Surveillance surveys are conducted after 24 months after elimination of TF as a public health problem.

VL attacks vital internal organs leading to their failure.26 The case fatality rate, usually within 2 years, approximates 95% if the disease is left untreated. Death is mainly due to organ failure, anemia, or secondary bacterial infections.27 In Kenya majority of patients are children living in rural areas (at least 50% are children <15 years). Males predominate (with a male to female ratio of 2:1). Factors that increase the risk of developing the disease include youth age, malnutrition, immunosuppressive diseases such as HIV, malignancies, and organ transplantation. Visceral leishmaniasis has caused epidemics with high case fatality due to accumulation of risk factors such as civil unrest, disruption of health systems, malnutrition, underlying diseases and absence of diagnostic facilities and first-line drugs at the local level. Visceral leishmaniasis in Kenya is endemic in 11 counties that include Baringo, West Pokot, Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Kitui, Tharaka Nithi and Kajiado (Figure 18).

It is characterized by ulcerative skin lesions and occasionally nodular, psoriasiform, and verrucous lesions. CL is the most common form of leishmaniasis globally. In Kenya it is represented in three different forms; localized CL, disseminated CL and cutaneous leishmaniasis recidivans. It is a disfiguring and stigmatizing disease with skin lesions, mainly ulcers, occurring on exposed parts of the body predominantly the face, leaving life-long scars and serious disability. Cutaneous leishmaniasis interventions in Kenya take the approach of case management and health promotion with minimal activities on vector control and surveillance. Current treatments are by the pentavalent antimonials which are costly and often require weeks of painful injections of toxic drugs. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Nakuru and Nyandarua counties and most recently cases have been reported in Kajiado county. # Figure 19: Number of CL Cases Reported From 2019 to 2021\n\n|Year|Nakuru|Nyandarua|\n|---|---|---|\n|2019|140| |\n|2020|120| |\n|2021|100| |\n\nIn 2016 an outbreak was reported in Nakuru and Nyandarua counties and over 500 cases were identified of which 55.7% of the cases were females.

Health workers training has been conducted in endemic areas although the number of trained health workers needs to be increased. New treatment centres need to be opened due to the geographical expansion of the disease to new areas that had not previously reported cases. In 2021, the Ministry of Health launched the first National Strategic Plan for Control of Leishmaniasis 2021-2025. The main strategic approaches in the Strategic Plan will focus on the rapid scale-up of access to interventions, enhanced planning for results, resource mobilization and financial sustainability. Other strategic approaches will be strengthening advocacy, coordination, national ownership, improved monitoring and evaluation, surveillance and research. # 1.3.10.6 Envisaged Strategies towards Elimination of Leishmaniasis as a Public Health Problem\n\n1. Improved case management for CL and VL\n\nProper diagnosis and prompt management of leishmaniasis cases are crucial in achieving the goal of elimination. The leishmaniasis programme will focus on developing and reviewing guidelines for the management of VL and CL, equipping health care workers with the relevant knowledge and skills, laboratory quality assurance and efficacy testing of medicines. Capacity building of more health workers and establishing more diagnosis and treatment centres. This will ensure early and prompt treatment of cases. ---\n# 2.

This strategy, though effective in addressing late stages of the disease, misses the early-stage cases in the community that may persist for months undetected or confounded by other diseases with similar symptoms such as malaria. The existence of early cases in the community may also serve as sources of transmission. Identifying and treating the early cases will improve treatment outcome and help in breaking transmission. # 3. Mapping new VL hotspots\n\nThis will involve mapping high risk areas of transmission of VL in the country and develop risk maps. Both vector surveillance and active case searches in counties bordering endemic areas will be done. The mapping will help identify VL hotspots in endemic areas and early control measures instituted. # 4. Strengthened supply chain management system for VL and CL\n\nIn this strategy, the programme aims at ensuring correct quantification and an adequate supply of leishmaniasis medical commodities (drugs and diagnostics). This will be achieved by employing various methods that include building capacity in endemic counties on quantification and forecasting, strengthening reporting for stock and adoption and use of KEMSA e-LMIS system to integrate leishmaniasis medicines and diagnostics. This will allow regular delivery of supplies through the standard health product ordering and delivery system. The programme will engage KEMSA to provide adequate logistic support from national to county level for delivery of medicines and diagnostic materials at affordable costs. # 5. Enhanced vector control mechanisms to reduce leishmaniasis transmission\n\nVector management is key in leishmaniasis transmission control. In Kenya, Phlebotomus sandflies are the main vectors known to transmit leishmaniasis. Sandflies, unlike mosquitoes, have poorly defined breeding areas and do not aggregate as juveniles that are amenable to environmental management. This strategy will target protecting persons against sandfly bites, controlling vector densities, and monitoring the occurrence and distributions of the sandflies in Kenya. # 6. Strengthened surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, and operational research for informed decision making\n\nSurveillance, monitoring, evaluation, learning, and research will be key processes in the leishmaniasis control strategy.

The indirect household losses represent more than 50% of total costs. The total PEP costs have been estimated at US$40 per patient in Africa and US$49 in Asia, accounting for 6% and 4% of annual per capita Gross National Income, respectively. In Kenya, the direct medical cost associated with a complete regime of PEP is estimated at $85 per person. Poor households face difficulties paying for PEP, which results in considerable financial hardship and substantial delays or failure in receiving the PEP. Shortages of PEP are also common, further increasing the costs as victims are forced to travel to far flung centres to obtain treatment. Success in rabies elimination has been demonstrated in many countries, including in developing countries where sustained mass vaccination of dogs has been shown to be the single most cost-effective intervention to control and eliminate canine rabies and consequently human rabies. Successful elimination of human rabies requires a multi-sectoral and collaborative approach. Prevention of dog rabies, effective surveillance in humans and animals, better public awareness, appropriate case management and improved access to human rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins, are essential for the elimination of human rabies. Kenya is implementing a national human rabies elimination strategy with a target of achieving zero human deaths from dog mediated rabies by 2030. Using a three-pronged approach, the strategy aims to reduce the disease risk through sustained mass dog vaccination, dog population.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IBO8/3mCq4BAqE3qa/Jr/dAPr4zWCu2ixR+zExX7zL0="},"21a53c5a-2d69-425d-bcfc-11c3d7d5f826":{"id_":"21a53c5a-2d69-425d-bcfc-11c3d7d5f826","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ed15acc-d289-4481-a3c0-b05c43125a71","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"IBO8/3mCq4BAqE3qa/Jr/dAPr4zWCu2ixR+zExX7zL0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"49699ff4-11f0-4e2b-b871-d6c83e077971","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"w6shFfpR4OaHRUDo0sMsQe8Mjb5kapAAoyWIkPZqGJo="}},"text":"---\n# KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n\n# 1.3.12 Snakebite Envenoming (SBE)\n\nSnakebite envenoming was listed as a priority Neglected Tropical Disease by WHO in 2017. Globally, approximately 5 million people experience snakebite every year resulting in over 1.8 million envenomation (6.2/100,000 per year).

Due to the threat of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases globally and the emphasis on these threats through the International Health Regulations (IHR), Kenya has established a One Health coordinating office, referred to as Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU), which forms a link between human and animal health sectors. The ZDU serves as the secretariat for the National Rabies Elimination Coordination Committee (NRECC) presenting an opportunity to promote inter-sectoral collaboration. The Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Human Rabies in Kenya 2014-2030 provides a guide for systematic reduction of rabies risk until the country is completely free of human dog-mediated rabies. This strategy is based on activities planned in accordance with the Stepwise Approach to Rabies Elimination (SARE) for the country to move from an endemic state to a disease-free status. SARE is a stepwise progression towards becoming a rabies disease-free country, consisting of 6 stages (Stage 0 to 5), each with a set of activities that build on each other to continuously reduce the risk of disease, with the country being declared completely free of human dog-mediated rabies when it reaches Stage 5.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"C/2y92IqFfiiNk2yxXCNA5D2/R1ZcUUT6VB9cjUHG28="},"49699ff4-11f0-4e2b-b871-d6c83e077971":{"id_":"49699ff4-11f0-4e2b-b871-d6c83e077971","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"21a53c5a-2d69-425d-bcfc-11c3d7d5f826","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"C/2y92IqFfiiNk2yxXCNA5D2/R1ZcUUT6VB9cjUHG28="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"11b8e1f1-a962-4892-9444-7907fb328ded","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"NmhCaMxpnttkcwiILhoMAYYRjX/sV1h8zvVPByQQQOc="}},"text":"# Figure 22: Zones For the Stepwise Rabies Elimination Strategy in Kenya\n\n|Timelines|Stages in the Rabies progressive control pathway|\n|---|---|\n|2030|STAGE 5: Maintain freedom from rabies status humans and dogs|\n|2028-2029|STAGE 4: Maintain freedom from dog-mediated human rabies|\n|2017-2027|STAGE 3: Rabies risk reduction through full-scale strategy implementation of the control|\n|2014-2019|STAGE 2: Implementation of the National Rabies control strategy pilot districts|\n|2013-2014|STAGE 1: Development and adoption of the National Rabies control strategy Preparation for its Implementation|\n|2013|STAGE 0: Rabies suspected to be present, scanty information available|\n\nThe critical steps in the various stages include (i) developing and adopting a national rabies elimination strategy (2013-2014), (ii) starting implementation of elimination plan in pilot areas (2014-2019), (iii) implementation of the elimination strategy throughout the country (2017-2027) and (iv) maintaining freedom from human dog mediated rabies and canine rabies (2028-2030).

The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated in 2017 that at least 220 million people required preventive chemotherapy against Onchocerciasis, 14.6 million of the infected people already had skin disease and 1.15 million had vision loss. More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The vectors of onchocerciasis are Simuliidae (blackfly). They are blood sucking Diptera which affect the health of man and animals in several ways. Some species within this family are vectors of filarial worms causing onchocerciasis in man and domestic animals. Onchocerca volvulus the filarial worm causing onchocerciasis in man is transmitted in most parts of Africa by species within the Simulium (Edwardsellum) damnosum complex. Species within the S. (E) damnosum complex have not been known to bite man in Kenya. In Kenya records show that the disease was transmitted by S (E) neavei in the areas formerly endemic for onchocerciasis.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MCyvr8t5OxeXc0VL0ClsNUoMs+1DmLDhRMV43jQCJq8="},"a4988cd3-c81f-48bc-9623-0e5345fa2c6d":{"id_":"a4988cd3-c81f-48bc-9623-0e5345fa2c6d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"af70c20c-4c57-4d5e-8eed-9dbd55b18224","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"MCyvr8t5OxeXc0VL0ClsNUoMs+1DmLDhRMV43jQCJq8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"18906191-4668-4077-83a1-9b7e73de725b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"pFmRWegM2XQpTvf1jifG6mSobtxGH2vt13kGhtVrb0M="}},"text":"37 https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis\n\n58 KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\n# Simuliidae and Onchocerciasis in Kenya\n\nSimuliidae select fast flowing streams where they lay their eggs either scattered over water or laid in masses on submerged vegetation or rocks. In the case of *Simulium naevei, records show that the preimaginal stages (larval and pupal) of Simulium naevei were found in phoretic association where they were attached to freshwater crabs of genus Potamonautes*.38 Because the blackfly vector requires fast flowing rivers and streams for breeding, the distribution of onchocerciasis is essentially focal, causing great suffering among the people who inhabit the fertile river valleys. In places where the Simuliidae are hyperabundant they cause direct injuries, intolerable nuisance, and even psychological effects in the hosts. In Kenya, onchocerciasis was originally endemic in six well-defined areas of western part of the country. The foci areas included the foothills of Mount Elgon, close to the Uganda border, Kodera Forest in Homabay, Ngoina in Kisii, Riana in Kericho, Kuja in Migori, Kaimosi in Vihiga and Kakamega forest. Elimination of the onchocerciasis vector *Simulium neavei* through the use of larvicides in focal areas of Kenya started in 1946 and spread over a period of around ten years up to 1956. In Kenya, the phoretic association of the *S. neavei group with fresh-water crabs of the species Potamonautes niloticus was only discovered in 1951 when McMahon found larvae and pupae of this group attached to riverine crabs in the Kipsonoi river in Kericho. This discovery is of great biological significance in the control of S. neavei* vectors in the former endemic foci of onchocerciasis in parts of western Kenya which is being targeted for the current situation analysis. # 1.3.12.1 Onchocerciasis Situation in Kenya\n\nRecords show that *S. neavei s.s.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0VbbD2wy3ncgSMJLEmP2ZX2YC78SeCh56FmZKfV/xdM="},"18906191-4668-4077-83a1-9b7e73de725b":{"id_":"18906191-4668-4077-83a1-9b7e73de725b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a4988cd3-c81f-48bc-9623-0e5345fa2c6d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"0VbbD2wy3ncgSMJLEmP2ZX2YC78SeCh56FmZKfV/xdM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a9529851-73c0-4f7a-805e-ec751c5a9f8c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"PgO46WU70Fu47yEjAi10N0o2pG1F08VmcPY868tHzTE="}},"text":"neavei s.s. is the only species within the subgenus Lewisellium that has been shown to transmit human onchocerciasis.

The control programme which was conducted in all the endemic foci of onchocerciasis lasted from 1946-1955 covering an area of approximately 4,000 km.38 The control of the vector using DDT involved the application of 18% DDT in emulsion oil to all infected rivers and their tributaries. Bush clearing was also used as a method of controlling S. neavei. It was conducted in Riana from 1943-1946. Buckley (1951) reported that the alteration of adult habitat by clearing the bush was responsible for the extinction of the flies. Treatment of infected people was also used as a control measure. This was done only on a very small scale. In a follow-up survey conducted in 1964 in four focal areas, approximately 2,000 people were examined parasitologically and clinically; slightly over half this group were also given detailed ophthalmological examination.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pFmRWegM2XQpTvf1jifG6mSobtxGH2vt13kGhtVrb0M="},"a9529851-73c0-4f7a-805e-ec751c5a9f8c":{"id_":"a9529851-73c0-4f7a-805e-ec751c5a9f8c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"18906191-4668-4077-83a1-9b7e73de725b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"pFmRWegM2XQpTvf1jifG6mSobtxGH2vt13kGhtVrb0M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0699ae37-67e3-4058-8616-f27cab41feca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"LoAvvWjsScfAYIG1GkWjdwpzbqDqPj/2pDW1iMqlj3E="}},"text":"The results showed that, 11 years after interruption of transmission,\n\n**Table 21: Distribution of Black Flies of Simulium Neavei Group**\n|Species|Distribution|\n|---|---|\n|Simulium neavei senso stricto (Roubaud 1915)|Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, Angola|\n|Simulium goinyi (Lewis and Hanney 1965)|Kenya, Uganda|\n|Simulium hightoni (Lewis 1961)|Kenya, Uganda|\n|Simulium nyasalandicum (De Meillon 1930)|Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania|\n\n38 McMAHON JP, HIGHTON RB, GOINY H.

In the 1970s to 1980s, several studies were conducted on S. naevei group by the MOH (DVBD) in partnership with researchers from neighboring countries. These studies were aimed at assessing the important biotic and abiotic factors that determine the existence, distribution, and development of Simulium vector species in Kenya. The studies focused on immature stages of S. naevei group because adult stages were not easily accessible and were rarely caught in the wild. The findings confirmed that the interruption of transmission of onchocerciasis in Kenya using larvicide was of great significance in reducing the number of the S. naevei vector population and in interrupting active transmission of the disease. Rapid epidemiological assessment was carried out in northwestern Kenya in Oct-Nov 2004 by (WHO/MOH and APOC Consultants) to determine the prevalence of Onchocerciasis among the Sudanese refugees in Kakuma camp, Eldoret, Trans-Nzoia and Kapenguria. A total number of 1421 refugees were screened. The result showed that Onchocerciasis is hypo-endemic (6%) among the refugees surveyed, existence of cases of severe onchocerca skin disease was observed. It was also observed that the prevalence (<2%) was very low. These results show the need for further investigation to ascertain where the positive cases originated from and whether there are current cases in the refugee camps. However, there has been no previous reported cases of onchocerciasis transmission in Kenya in the dry Northern parts of the country including Kakuma. A survey conducted in 20 countries by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) reported that Kenya is not among those countries classified as high risk for onchocerciasis. In this survey, only 8 persons out of 3,822 examined (0.2%) in Kenya had palpable nodules and given these nodules are not 100%, this supported earlier conclusions that elimination is realized in Kenya. Onchocerciasis elimination mapping in those formerly endemic regions was done in 2018 to establish the status of Onchocerciasis transmission in Kenya including the risk of transmission from the neighboring countries.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LoAvvWjsScfAYIG1GkWjdwpzbqDqPj/2pDW1iMqlj3E="},"fb2862e6-6501-4b72-9b02-fd41129cf976":{"id_":"fb2862e6-6501-4b72-9b02-fd41129cf976","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0699ae37-67e3-4058-8616-f27cab41feca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"LoAvvWjsScfAYIG1GkWjdwpzbqDqPj/2pDW1iMqlj3E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b40468d7-340a-4cb6-b175-5767e5c3149c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"gftxIXgLJf1bUPP18FWV2Ih8owF4F6KUWkW2mwfY0hA="}},"text":"Blood samples were collected from selected individuals, Random Diagnostic test (OV16) was then run on them, Dry Blood Spot (DBS) was also collected from all participants for Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) but was run for positive cases and an additional 5% of negative for quality assurance.

Sleeping sickness in Kenya was first reported in 1902 and became the main focus of tsetse control in the country. The disease was caused by T brucei rhodesiense, which is endemic in the Lake Victoria basin. It is characterized by localized outbreaks transmitted by G fuscipes and G. pallidipes. Historically outbreaks have occurred in Homabay, Siaya, Bungoma and Busia Counties and few reported cases in Migori and Narok counties. The potential of human sleeping sickness outbreak recurring is high in the Lake Victoria basin and the Serengeti-Mara region. The disease is fatal with high costs of medication with accompanying losses of manpower negatively affecting the economy. Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) affects the population and the productivity of the people. The cost of the disease is extremely difficult to quantify. According to WHO (2003) at least 60 million people are at risk of contracting the disease in Africa while 11 million Kenyans are at risk. # 1.3.13.3 Animal Disease\n\nThe economic losses attributable to Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis are realized through Cost of human and animal treatment, death of infected human and animals, abortions, loss of milk, loss of draught power and inability to plough in certain areas, inaccessibility to grazing grounds, low market value for affected animals, loss of foreign exchange through imports of drugs/pesticides and lost opportunity to export livestock and livestock products. Other parasite species and sub-species of the Trypanosoma genus are pathogenic to animals and cause animal trypanosomiasis in wild and domestic animals. Animals can host the human pathogen parasites, especially T.b. rhodesiense, of which domestic and wild animals are important reservoirs. Animals can also be infected with T.b. gambiense and act as reservoirs to a lesser extent. However, the precise epidemiological role of the animal reservoir in the gambiense form of the disease is not yet well known.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gftxIXgLJf1bUPP18FWV2Ih8owF4F6KUWkW2mwfY0hA="},"50582ac4-2e52-4f76-8e8e-f07069605993":{"id_":"50582ac4-2e52-4f76-8e8e-f07069605993","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b40468d7-340a-4cb6-b175-5767e5c3149c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"gftxIXgLJf1bUPP18FWV2Ih8owF4F6KUWkW2mwfY0hA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"28670e77-ffd6-4aee-bb32-0a180189fb2f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"AS4ETqvZ6t5uy8j+4cwE5QomREOYjCvG336rjRyQmSM="}},"text":"The tourism industry accounts for 21% of total foreign exchange earnings and up to 12% of the Country’s GDP while wildlife contributes 70% of tourism earnings and yet T&T infestation directly affects tourism due to threats of HAT. The threat to wildlife and unwillingness of tourists to visit tsetse infested areas contributes to loss in tourism earnings. The trans-boundary nature of Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis requires a strong coordination framework with a mandate transcending political borders and capable of linking with international organizations for tsetse eradication. The East African Community (EAC) coordination is key in addressing this challenge. # 1.3.13.4 Major Human Epidemics\n\nSeveral epidemics occurred in Africa over the last century:\n\n- One between 1896 and 1906, in Uganda and the Congo Basin\n- One in 1920 in several African countries\n- Most recent epidemic started in 1970 and lasted until the late 1990s. KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027 61\n---\n# The 1920 epidemic was controlled by mobile teams who screened millions of people at risk. By the mid-1960s, it was controlled to less than 5,000 cases reported in the whole continent. With relaxed surveillance, the disease reappeared, reaching epidemic proportions in several regions by 1970. Efforts of WHO, national control programmes, bilateral cooperation and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the 1990s and early 21st century reversed the curve. International coordinated efforts dropped the number of new HAT cases reported between 2000 and 2012 significantly. Hence, the WHO neglected tropical diseases road map targeted its elimination as a public health problem by 2020 and interruption of transmission (zero cases) for 2030. # 1.3.13.5 Disease Burden\n\nSleeping sickness threatens millions of people in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Many affected populations in remote rural areas with limited access to adequate health services, which complicates surveillance and therefore diagnosis and treatment of cases. In addition, displacement of populations, war and poverty are factors that facilitate transmission.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YLRKRFRyymT5Ev3V7zjbXroZwPJqAuM50Mn1+itLyyk="},"28670e77-ffd6-4aee-bb32-0a180189fb2f":{"id_":"28670e77-ffd6-4aee-bb32-0a180189fb2f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"50582ac4-2e52-4f76-8e8e-f07069605993","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"YLRKRFRyymT5Ev3V7zjbXroZwPJqAuM50Mn1+itLyyk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5a7e5b1c-b594-48e8-b427-3c164156f505","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"esGo4mYTYkt2tN6YPicHoozoVDCUiO2fUrM85kusXIY="}},"text":"In addition, displacement of populations, war and poverty are factors that facilitate transmission. # 1.3.13.6 Data over the Last Five Years (2016-2021)\n\nNo local cases were detected and treated in Kenya in the last five years by both active and passive surveillance according to the National Sleeping Sickness Referral Hospital (NSSRH, unpublished data).

Leprosy disabilities significantly lower quality of life. Child proportion of 2.7% was recorded in 2021 (n=109) while the NSP baseline was 6% and the set target was 3%. This demonstrates positive progress which surpassed the target. However, the detection of children shows that transmission of Leprosy is also ongoing in communities. Multibacillary leprosy proportion has consistently been above 95%; this gives an insight into the burden of Leprosy in the community. End term review for TB /Leprosy and lung health 2015 -2018 findings revealed a low level of knowledge and awareness at both the community and health facility (HF) levels in the sub-Counties. KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n---\nFurthermore, there were no IEC materials in HFs across the Counties; this could contribute to the inadequate knowledge and awareness observed at the HF and Community levels. Strategies and structures to support early cases finding (active screening at HF and community level, contact investigation, management and rehabilitation for people affected by Leprosy who have disability) are inadequate at all levels. # 1.3.15 Arboviruses – Dengue and Chikungunya\n\n# 1.3.15.1 Dengue Fever\n\nDengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted to humans through bites by infected female mosquitoes primarily of the species *Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Ae. Albopictus (WHO 2014). It is caused by dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family and there are four distinct, but closely related, serotypes with distinct epidemiological patterns of the virus that cause dengue (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iP/ACT7aHUts5ul21X1yFuf/5O96TRYyf18OJcabykE="},"c1fec597-c6b7-4ca5-a388-d5096ccc3577":{"id_":"c1fec597-c6b7-4ca5-a388-d5096ccc3577","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7fb527da-c800-4330-a941-2dd5b98fc325","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"iP/ACT7aHUts5ul21X1yFuf/5O96TRYyf18OJcabykE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ba512395-db77-4c2d-9391-3c117eb96f4f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"3fhNtjEoRO+aHNZwi5vlpA+NFirTLPIYnpiQkzMZaEY="}},"text":"Aedes aegypti* could breed in natural containers such as tree holes and bromeliads but it has well adapted to urban habitats and breeds mostly in man-made containers including buckets, mud pots, discarded containers and used tires, storm water drains etc., thus making dengue fever an insidious disease in densely populated urban centers. Dengue has an alarming impact on both global and national economies. Urbanization is associated with dengue transmission through multiple social and environmental factors like population density, human mobility, access to reliable water source and water storage practice. Community’s risks to dengue also depend on population’s knowledge, attitude and practice towards dengue, as well as the implementation of routine sustainable vector control activities in the community. Disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, and vectors might adapt to new environment and climate. One-third of the world’s population (2.5 billion) is at risk of infection with DENV and it is estimated that approximately 390 million dengue virus infections occur per year (95% credible interval 284–528 million), and 96 million (67–136 million) manifest clinically. The number of dengue cases reported to WHO increased over 8-fold in the last two decades, from 505,430 cases in 2000 to over 2.4 million in 2010, and 5.2 million in 2019.

Aegypti confined within the tropics and sub-tropics and Ae. Albopictus which occurs in temperate regions. It was first identified in 1952 in Tanzania but since 2004, there has been a rapid spread throughout 60 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Americas. WHO's African Regional Office (AFRO) recorded an outbreak in Senegal, representing the first active circulation in the area in five years. In 2016, 1874 cases with 32 labs confirmed and 0 deaths were reported in Mandera County and 123 cases and 0 deaths in Mombasa County. In 2018, outbreaks were reported in Mombasa County with 965 cases, 34 labs confirmed and 0 deaths; Lamu County with 199 reported cases, 4 labs confirmed and 0 deaths and Kilifi County with 7 reported cases, 2 labs confirmed and 0 deaths. At present, the main method to control or prevent the transmission of Chikungunya virus is to combat mosquito vectors achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected and at-risk communities, to empty and clean containers that contain water on a weekly basis to inhibit mosquito breeding and the subsequent production of adults.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sH+Z28H0K0pIypiBR0qnrma9ay4R2722Eodef0RjRvA="},"e340a885-630d-4397-b6f2-ea3782efbdc8":{"id_":"e340a885-630d-4397-b6f2-ea3782efbdc8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f59ff9e5-c2ba-4058-9c96-cbf7a80e2d39","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"sH+Z28H0K0pIypiBR0qnrma9ay4R2722Eodef0RjRvA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"850ffe15-5041-4dd5-952b-0ed32c6061f4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"OgSaSSrr0/R9swNid3FFZgWCQEvZQfnUONCUHqteP+c="}},"text":"Sustained community efforts to reduce mosquito breeding can be an effective tool to reduce vector populations.

HAT and Onchocerciasis were formerly endemic in 6 counties each. Several activities have been undertaken towards elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF). This includes successfully conducting annual MDA in all 23 endemic areas, leading to over 90% therapeutic coverage in these areas. However, the programme was unable to conduct TAS, passive surveillance and preparation and submission of ‘dossier’ for in-country verification of absence of LF transmission. Elimination of Trachoma remained on course with 34 implementing units (IUs) achieving elimination of blinding trachoma, over 40,000 surgeries conducted (98% of target) and prevalence survey conducted in all of the 53 IUs. Community-based treatment was initiated in 23 IUs achieving 100% geographical coverage. However, there were delays in conducting MDA which in turn delayed other subsequent activities such as impact assessments and passive surveillance. To eliminate morbidity due to SCH, the programme conducted MDA in some of the endemic areas but not all targeted areas were reached due to funding constraints. Most MDA activities were implemented through the school health programme reaching a therapeutic coverage of 75%. No surveillance or impact assessments were conducted during the 2016 – 2020 period although data from the school health programme showed reductions of S. mansoni in some areas from 2.1% to 1.7%. Access to water and sanitation remained a major challenge in endemic areas. For example, in the coastal region, between 1.6% and 80.6% of households had no toilet facilities and between 2.6% and 91.3% were using unprotected water. For the control of STH, MDA was implemented in all 94 IUs, reaching a therapeutic coverage of 75%. However, no impact assessment was conducted during this period. The programme achieved 100% for active case detection as well as 100% treatment coverage for control of Visceral Leishmaniasis in all 30 targeted IUs. However, vector control through integrated vector management, sentinel site surveillance and passive surveillance were not implemented.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hDu2e0fKvDC9DUr2bSMKq4AHq/j8tV5cJiITAZBByg8="},"aad151b0-d477-4d23-883a-3f56319db964":{"id_":"aad151b0-d477-4d23-883a-3f56319db964","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fb646509-fec6-4a4f-abdf-d16aa7c50128","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"hDu2e0fKvDC9DUr2bSMKq4AHq/j8tV5cJiITAZBByg8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7bf8979c-ddc0-44dd-8ecc-19af1dcfda2b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"jIdea6c8++/fOrIDK6gf2rVXiIqDT8RF8iqz391YHRs="}},"text":"However, vector control through integrated vector management, sentinel site surveillance and passive surveillance were not implemented.

For STH/SCH, mapping was conducted in all 130 wards in coastal region and the programme conducted two rounds of MDA in 2019 and 2020. For LF, the following activities were achieved: annual MDA of Di-ethyl Carbamazine (DEC) and albendazole was implemented in endemic counties; health promotion and behavior change communication; training of community drug distributor (CDD) trainers and CDD; advocacy with counties; and pre TAS in 50% of the endemic counties. In collaboration with partners, the programme trained and certified Trachoma Trichiasis surgeons and conducted 15,767 surgeries during the 2016-2020 period. However, there was a backlog of 5,000 surgeries. These surgeries have been completed and what is left are the residual cases which the counties have committed to take up through the existing health system. For LF, the programme trained health care workers in hydrocele surgery which led to 474 surgeries conducted out a target of 5,000 surgeries. Lymphoedema management was scaled up in all endemic areas. At community level, the program focused on identification of hydrocele. Treatment guidelines for Leishmaniasis were reviewed and disseminated. Leishmaniasis medicines were procured, and health care workers trained in all endemic areas. Field reports showed that over 95% of Leishmaniasis cases were diagnosed and treated. No activities were implemented for Cystic Echinococcosis, HAT and Onchocerciasis. The programme acquired additional office space after merging with the Vector Borne Disease Control unit, received seven vehicles for use by implementing partners for Trachoma elimination activities and four laptops. Several guidelines and IEC materials were developed during this period including BTS, SBE guidelines, IEC materials for various disease areas, Leishmaniasis Treatment Guidelines and GWD Combi Strategy.

STH/SCH expenditure reached over Kes 1.3 billion and that for LF reached US$6.2 million. Trachoma and Leishmaniasis activities reached expenditures of Kes 3.93 billion and Kes 73 million, respectively. MOH and county expenditure data for NTDs were not available. It was therefore not possible to assess whether the Division was able to raise enough funds for programme activities or not. Most routine data for NTDs are captured monthly on DHIS2 while others are recorded on Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response (IDSR) surveillance tool (MOH 705A/B). Data sharing meetings were held from time to time and data was used to map endemic areas, focus MDA and surveys activities. Leishmaniasis case data was used to set up treatment centres and guide procurement of medicines and supplies. MDA coverage data was used to plan for TAS and pre-TAS surveys for LF. The programme used Open Data Kit (ODK) mobile data collection apps for mapping and surveys and Google sheets to document coverage of MDA. However, no operations research was conducted during the 2016 – 2022 period.

Procurement of supplies and medicines experienced delays with signing of MOUs and clearing of commodities at the airport. However, storage of commodities at KEMSA was adequate and distribution of some of the commodities to counties was undertaken without approval from the Division leading to shortages when the commodities were needed. Counties have been mobilized to lead the implementation of NTD control activities and allocate their own resources accordingly. As many counties have functional CHVs, it is convenient and efficient to engage them in community-based mobilization and distribution of drugs as well as provision of health education messages. There were several partners supporting each disease program that helped the Division to scale up some of the activities. Going forward, the Division will focus on “low hanging fruits” for quick wins. For example, HAT cases have not been reported for more than a decade while Onchocerciasis has not been reported for several decades. There is great progress with elimination of LF and Trachoma and the Division needs to focus on scaling up remaining intervention to reach elimination targets and to start preparing the “dossier. ” For STH/SCH, the highest prevalence was in areas that lack adequate and clean water, hygiene and sanitation. The Division needs to improve coordination and collaboration with the school health programme and with WASH partners. As WASH interventions can be resource intensive, the Division needs to advocate with the Counties, partners, and communities to invest in this area. There is a need to conduct a major social mobilization in counties with endemic NTDs and to get the counties to own the programme and lead activities in their areas in addition to allocating budgets for NTD control and elimination. The Division needs to review its capacity to align it with the requirements of the new Master Plan for an effective management of the programme.

Yet to date, the WASH component has received little attention and the potential to link efforts on WASH and NTDs has been largely untapped. Focused efforts on WASH are urgently needed if the global NTD roadmap targets are to be met. This is especially needed for NTDs where transmission is most closely linked to poor WASH conditions such as STH, SCH, Trachoma and LF. ---\n# KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n\nCurrently data on WASH is collected at the household (HH) level and reported through DHIS 2 with only 3 indicators (No. of HH with latrines, No. of HH using treated water and No. of HH with hand washing facilities). There is no standard data on WASH in schools and health facilities. Most NTD endemic areas have low WASH investments with counties focusing on treatment and care rather than preventive care which requires long-term investments. In NTD endemic areas for SCH, STH, and Trachoma, most HH practice open defecation, lack access to safe water and lack basic hand washing facilities with water and soap. WASH partners in endemic areas provide interventions that overlap each other, with limited scope leaving out other needy areas, limited budget and thus a call for collaborations and partnerships creation within the WASH sector. A joint approach that addresses the causes of NTDs is likely to be more cost effective over the long term and more sustainable. It will also ensure that investments in WASH reach those most in need. Beyond the objectives of each sector, collaboration can also serve to achieve common goals such as health and well-being, equity, shared prosperity, and sustainability. The behavior change element for NTDs prevention and control is still relatively new and far less standardized in its design and implementation compared with established drug treatment approaches. An additional gap is comparatively less funding invested to evaluate change in behaviors and make a case for further investment. However, the narrative is moving towards more holistic approaches to eliminate NTDs. For example, Community Led Total Sanitation has a major behavior change component.

However, with the increased access to social media and the recognition that different people have different information needs and access different media, there have been innovations in health communication. The MoH through the DVBNTD has, in the last 4 years, adopted innovative ways of communication through the adoption of a social mobilization package as an innovation in 2018, to ensure that all populations in Lamu East, Lamu West and Jomvu sub-counties took part in the IDA (Ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and Albendazole) intervention for LF.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+9phY4MhI0BOE7qUiehBm+Dzy2BMCsy4ilXw1KS2Y1E="},"434edb35-d33d-425f-9e84-476b6de8cd31":{"id_":"434edb35-d33d-425f-9e84-476b6de8cd31","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"92f19c0d-c220-4b41-9fce-f830b92c2cfc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"+9phY4MhI0BOE7qUiehBm+Dzy2BMCsy4ilXw1KS2Y1E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"26f1a378-f4ff-4982-bbdf-7b9f1dcdcb78","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"sz6hbs4f7e7sazibZLMNFvU2mrNtXCuJ0XKnTJEmwtw="}},"text":"The Division expanded health communication to include social media (Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter), public address system, documentaries (short clips that were shared on social media) and live talk shows over and above the distribution of flyers, posters, public meetings and use of CHV. Social mobilization has since been expanded into the STH/SCH microplanning with a keen focus on targeted approach. The microplanning project has facilitated the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which will be reviewed and adapted for use. # 1.3.18.3 Community Sensitization and Social Mobilization Activities\n\nEvidence has shown that community participation is critical to the success of any public health program aimed at reducing exposure to, controlling, or eliminating diseases. Communities have knowledge and resources that can be tapped into for enhanced program success. There are beliefs and practices among community groups which can be detrimental to any health project that need to be addressed as part of programming. The current top-down approach to MDA, although effective in the short-term, is not sustainable. It is therefore important for SBCC and advocacy campaigns to be used to educate, create awareness, and demystify NTDs. The key community sensitization and social mobilization activities proposed in this NTD Master Plan period include to:\n\n- Carry out periodic KAP assessments to understand social cultural context of targeted population\n- Customize IEC materials to resonate with local culture, language, religion and social dynamics to encourage behaviour change, e.g. educate communities on provision and use of toilets, hand-washing before food preparation, after toilet use, and before eating, etc\n- Encourage the use of Continuous Medical Education (CME) platforms to propagate the WASH/BCC agenda e.g., Out-patient bays, MNCH clinic days, out-reach programs etc\n- Hold targeted workshops and community meetings to improve the level of knowledge, awareness and ownership among community members. These may be local opinion leaders, religious leaders, program implementers, government officials and other stakeholders. - Engage communities through participatory community approaches for ownership and sustainability of interventions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jbieiNWEq/4XYBGUe3R061yTUW6nqfUUXzJ3mDlf2r0="},"26f1a378-f4ff-4982-bbdf-7b9f1dcdcb78":{"id_":"26f1a378-f4ff-4982-bbdf-7b9f1dcdcb78","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"434edb35-d33d-425f-9e84-476b6de8cd31","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"jbieiNWEq/4XYBGUe3R061yTUW6nqfUUXzJ3mDlf2r0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4df46309-c239-4b6d-8f5f-b323f0f72540","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"m673uu8Pu5czKZzhHAAIb2NWPIm5LLh216ccqcZAHcM="}},"text":"- Engage communities through participatory community approaches for ownership and sustainability of interventions.

These include albendazole for lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases, azithromycin for trachoma, diethylcarbamazine citrate for lymphatic filariasis, ivermectin for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, mebendazole for soil-transmitted helminthiases and praziquantel for schistosomiasis. This is used for MDA at country level for populations at risk. WHO SOPs were developed by ASCEND (accelerating the sustainable control and elimination of NTDs) program in collaboration with New Concept Information Systems Pvt. Ltd, to reflect key characteristics in the supply chain management of health products. These were for use in health ministries and national programs for NTDs to adopt and adapt them to their country context to strengthen its capacity. This was adopted by Kenya. The national NTD program prepares and submits the joint application packages (JAP) to the WHO for upcoming MDAs. The JAP comprises a set of four joint forms i.e. Joint Request for Selected Medicines (JRSM), Joint Reporting Form (JRF), Epidemiological Reporting Form (EpiRF) and Annual Work Plan (AWP). These are used to apply for drugs, report on their use and plan for MDA distribution with an extra 3% projection. The diseases targeted are LF, Onchocerciasis (ONCHO), SCH and STH. The JAP is submitted at least 10 months ahead of the planned MDA. To meet the coverage targets of an MDA, SOPs actualize the process. From planning and quantifying needs, moving stock from production sites to patients at the service delivery points, communities, schools, and hospitals, retrieving and accounting for leftover stock.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"m673uu8Pu5czKZzhHAAIb2NWPIm5LLh216ccqcZAHcM="},"d7a8d219-d85a-48c8-a25c-1322a17f6478":{"id_":"d7a8d219-d85a-48c8-a25c-1322a17f6478","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4df46309-c239-4b6d-8f5f-b323f0f72540","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"m673uu8Pu5czKZzhHAAIb2NWPIm5LLh216ccqcZAHcM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"616cf8ec-85dc-462d-8f65-30d33434a4dc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"pk6FvHjKTlnY5AlFup0kFfKliNBG0eLbwROHGZQy+hY="}},"text":"An effective supply chain\n---\n# KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 - 2027\n\nensures timely access and availability of quality-assured medicines, products and pharmaceutical supplies at all levels thus avoiding stock out, wastage and loss of tablets. # Trachoma\n\nFor trachoma, International Trachoma Initiative (ITI), a partner supporting the program, procures the required antibiotics. The need for trachoma MDA is informed through data received from surveys done in endemic regions. The quantity of drugs required are determined for areas where the prevalence of active trachoma is above 5%. A round of MDA is done once a year for trachoma. One round of MDA is done for areas with a prevalence of 5-9.9%, three rounds for areas with prevalence of 10-29.9%, five rounds for areas with a prevalence of 30-49.9% and seven rounds for areas with a prevalence of above 50%. The reports from the MDA give the population estimates and therefore adjustments are made respectively. Resurveys are done every 24 months in areas where prevalence is below 5% (non-endemic regions). # Leishmaniasis\n\nFor Leishmaniasis, forecasting and evaluation of required commodities is done based on previous year’s reported cases.

The DNMP confirmed this for several counties and sub-counties55 particularly Homabay and Migori counties where both integrated vector control has been applied using both long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying as the main vector control interventions. An official list of notifiable medical conditions (NMCs) in Kenya could not be accessed online or by other means but the responses of the various groups of participants varied and were different from those listed in an assessment of NMCs in 2014 in Kenya.56\n\nA detailed Report has been compiled and will be used during the development of the National IVM Strategy for Kenya.

This is even more urgent given devolution of health services including NTD service delivery and the need to have functional governance mechanisms at both levels. This is critical in fulfilling key objectives such as:\n\n- Engage and empower individuals and communities to play an active role in prevention and treatment of NTDs. - Provide a forum for the media, private sector and the academia to contribute to the NTD elimination agenda. - Provide coordination mechanism with other sectors such as WASH, Agriculture, Education, etc. to play a key role in NTD elimination. The key structures necessary for implementation of this master plan are presented in Figure 35. They include National NTD Steering Committee, National and County Health Management Teams, National and County Inter-sectoral Coordination Committees, development partners and other relevant stakeholders in NTD prevention, control and elimination.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"p0m9Q2wTRvXaETdyqo8TtFbYSuQBuV7xgdT6CqO4cIU="},"e47c31cd-d444-4d17-b56d-ef646d1ae482":{"id_":"e47c31cd-d444-4d17-b56d-ef646d1ae482","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f10cc6e4-82ea-4c1f-ac7a-22bd79037cd9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"p0m9Q2wTRvXaETdyqo8TtFbYSuQBuV7xgdT6CqO4cIU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ec52524f-22b6-42e4-a539-d371b46e51e5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"74jTQVMWM+hORAnZYIDF7HxfoYQmBTWF43Tb/nPKp/s="}},"text":"KENYA NTD MASTER PLAN 2023 -

For each strategic initiative, details are provided for the activities and sub-activities that will be implemented to achieve a successful programme. In addition, key resources, and the timeframe for implementing these activities are provided. # 3.2 Strategic Pillar 1 - Accelerating Programmatic Action\n\nPillar 1 focuses on the clinical aspects of NTD prevention and control. The two main interventions are preventive chemotherapy and case management. Preventive chemotherapy will mainly be done through MDA in schools and communities. MDA involves identifying communities where treatment is needed, raising community awareness and buy-in, training community drug volunteers’ distributors, transporting the drugs to the field, distributing the drugs and evaluating the impact of the treatment. NTDs targeted for preventive chemotherapy in Kenya include LF, Trachoma, SCH and STH. Since 2018, the WHO guidelines on leprosy also recommended chemoprophylaxis for leprosy in the form of a single dose of rifampicin given to the group most at risk, close contacts of leprosy patients. For effective cross-border programming, Trachoma MDAs will be jointly administered in Kenya and Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia at designated borders. NTDs targeted for case management are Leishmaniasis, Trachoma Trichiasis, LF disabilities (hydrocoele and elephantiasis), female genital schistosomiasis, snakebite envenoming (SBE), vaccination for rabies, and cystic echinococcosis. In addition, arbovirus, scabies and other ectoparasites will be focused on in this pillar. Rehabilitation, treatment and contact tracing will be carried out for leprosy. Efforts will be geared towards the elimination of onchocerciasis and HAT.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"W1OANjar7b0Knavyc55BbZeU8IN0Yzni/8EMDgxopf0="},"2a084fa3-2438-479b-b616-931d0d4c18e1":{"id_":"2a084fa3-2438-479b-b616-931d0d4c18e1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9b0b0079-dc44-4a18-9341-0b10f40c9a2e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"W1OANjar7b0Knavyc55BbZeU8IN0Yzni/8EMDgxopf0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"139aecc4-ee0e-4589-bb76-4f37925b2cdf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"LeEH1qvNkuMhZ93Lf6kK8OC4fp6Gf7YpZiWfaW0X0lk="}},"text":"Efforts will be geared towards the elimination of onchocerciasis and HAT. Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of NTDs is crucial towards achieving the goal of this strategy. Individual case management will be conducted for leishmaniasis. Expanding the availability of surgery for men with hydrocele due to lymphatic filariasis is also an aim of the program. Treatment for trachoma will focus on treating the symptoms and helping to prevent future infection. This will use the SAFE strategy (surgery (S), antibiotics (A), facial cleanliness (F) and environmental educational efforts (E) which is a multi-pronged approach. This pillar will focus on updating and disseminating relevant documents, enhancing the skills of healthcare providers, and ensuring access to diagnosis and treatment commodities. Treatment guidelines for various NTDs including snakebite envenoming will be revised and disseminated. Training of health workers on NTDs will be undertaken in the respective endemic counties for various NTDs for both the public and private sector. Focused support supervision will also be carried out post the training.

Lot-to-lot testing will be performed to ensure the quality of mRDTs. To support effective preventive chemotherapy and case management activities, supply chain management will be strengthened at sub-county, health facility and community levels. Procurement, warehousing, and distribution of all diagnostic and treatment commodities for NTDs together with vaccines will be carried out to ensure stock up levels are adequate and subsequently

This pillar is critical in mainstreaming NTD activities across the national, county and community health systems. A robust monitoring and evaluation system is required for achieving the elimination of NTDs. Mapping and baseline surveys will be conducted to determine the prevalence of NTDs and identify counties and sub-counties with active transmission of NTDs. Monitoring will be required to determine coverage of MDA and post marketing surveillance. Routine M&amp;E will be strengthened to access progress and use the data to focus interventions to where they are most needed. Following implementation of the 2nd Kenya NTD Master Plan, the programme will be evaluated to determine the impact of previous actions and adjust the programme accordingly. For NTDs targeted for elimination such as Trachoma, LF, Onchocerciasis and HAT, surveillance will become the core activity implemented in health facilities and laboratories for early detection of any re-emergence of cases. Knowledge management is important to ensure accurate, complete, and timely data is available to counties and stakeholders for use in decision-making. Knowledge management activities have therefore been included under this pillar. Previous NTD Master Plans did not include the laboratory component which is critical for accurate diagnosis, monitoring and surveillance of NTDs. Reference laboratories will be strengthened to support the NTD programme and laboratory network established in regions to provide quality control and quality assurance. Laboratory technicians will be trained in NTDs diagnostics and deployed appropriately. Integrated vector management (IVM) is a rational and systematic process in decision-making that involves optimal use of resources for efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable vector control. The programme will strengthen IVM through increased capacity, improved surveillance, better coordination and integrated action across sectors and diseases, including the malaria programme. IVM has been shown to be effective in tackling NTDs. Innovative IVM strategies will be explored under this pillar. # The Role of Laboratory in DVBNTD\n\nThe laboratory is an essential component for disease surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases. Its primary functions are the identification and characterization of infectious agents and the development of serological tests. After prevention and control programs are underway, confirmation of diagnosis remains essential. As programs near the state of disease elimination or eradication, the laboratory role is critical in ensuring accurate diagnosis of suspicious illness.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tHAD9klQnmHfRkB2Jh0T/u5s0yH7SBdXt75s8XVHeoo="},"aeb56260-e403-479f-b338-067bd114b25f":{"id_":"aeb56260-e403-479f-b338-067bd114b25f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"16af4a80-a0d2-4c55-a0be-21c9b0b9f225","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"tHAD9klQnmHfRkB2Jh0T/u5s0yH7SBdXt75s8XVHeoo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fd3ce26e-ba1b-4633-bb3b-c4efcd7ae1fa","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"bONFoEKU+niegCmw9Z8kaYUoJJ2Z/na4haF53pO5UfY="}},"text":"In the current global effort to eradicate most NTDs, the laboratory has a leading role in identifying the targeted infectious agents. Laboratories have also been shown to play a critical role in antimicrobial resistance by identifying the resistance patterns for the various micro-organisms. # Laboratory Network\n\nBefore implementation of the new constitution where health is devolved, the DVBNTDs had several satellite laboratories spread across the country for monitoring specific NTDs. The devolved unit converted them for other routine health functions. There is need to reactivate opening of these labs and partner closely with devolved unit as we gear toward eliminating some of the NTDS. # Achievements\n\nDespite the arrangements, the NTD program has manage to do quite a lot in terms of its laboratory obligations by partnering with county government in supporting various transmission assessments surveys for LF in coastal counties and granular

For Kenya to achieve its NTDs control and elimination targets by 2027, additional resources are urgently required. Current donors will be requested to provide additional resources and new donors will be recruited. Advocacy will be carried out at both national and county governments targeting policy and decision makers. The focus will be on the economic, social and psychological burden that results from NTDs infections and the cost of treating these diseases, despite free health care in the country and universal health coverage initiative, in order to develop NTD budget line items and allocate NTD funds progressively each year. To mainstream county ownership, county governments will recruit NTD focal points, incorporate NTDs in County Integrated Development Plans, and Annual work plans to fund implementation of NTD interventions. To promote sustainability, transition plans will be developed so that counties take up increased responsibilities for leading, funding, and implementing NTD interventions. Health promotion activities will be strengthened at community level to achieve community ownership of their health, to control and prevent infections and re-infections, and increase demand for health care products and services. These will be done by increasing communication and social mobilization using health materials and messages via local radio talk shows, national TV and Radios, posters, brochures, health care workers, digital platforms and CHVs among others. Innovations in messaging will be used especially puppetry, card games, theatres and plays that will be integrated in school health clubs to instill and encourage behavior changes in learners for sustained control and elimination of NTDs. WASH-related activities will be expanded to promote healthy behavior through social and behavior change communication. Access to safe water and use is key in control and elimination of some NTDs while provision and use of functional latrines for safe disposal of fecal matter and urine prevents infections and reinfections of STH, Trachoma and SCH. Hand hygiene is also key in controlling infections that are transmitted via fecal oral route, and fomites. Provision of hand washing facilities in schools, health facilities and at household level.

areas. Kenya was the first country to pilot the triple therapy of LF interventions that reduced the number of MDAs needed to achieve elimination to 2 instead of the usual 5 five years using Ivermectin, Diethylcarbamazine and albendazole in three endemic regions (Lamu East, Lamu West and Jomvu). The three regions passed the transmission assessment survey indicating that LF was no longer a disease of public health importance. Trachoma endemic areas with high burden of the disease are currently undergoing biannual MDAs to intensify the push for elimination. Kenya is gearing to have achieved certification of elimination for Onchocerciasis, HAT, LF and Trachoma during the lifetime of this master plan. There has been expansion of interventions to other NTDs that were formerly not given much attention due to the thin staff at the division. Innovative approaches have been embraced to ensure the program has data driven interventions. Some of the key interventions include, expanding the map of STH and SCH in the country through mapping out of the high burden areas of the diseases in the country. The program has included Snakebite Envenoming (SBE) in the MDA questionnaire for trachoma endemic regions which are suspected to be endemic for SBE, the division further plans to roll out the same for STH and SCH. Questions on SBE have also been included in the coverage evaluation survey for LF to capture the data on SBE. The division has also carried out a successful integrated survey which includes transmission assessment of LF, impacts of interventions on STH and mapping out of tungiasis prevalence in Kwale and Kilifi. The division has also adopted a microplanning and monitoring tool called Reveal to help support STH and SCH MDA in the western region, this makes it easier to plan to the ward level. The division works in collaboration with the counties, through its persistent lobbying, the counties have been able to allocate NTD coordinators both at the county level and sub county level. This has made it easier in terms of coordination of NTD related activities. The division has further created capacity to manage MDAs and interventions of LF, Trachoma, STH, SCH and leishmaniasis by the counties through a well-coordinated approach.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"k3S3wlrBm8z/Ox+crCrd7OFbKYoHmRL1+oASHMMXb8Q="},"6f6c5a61-9cab-42fa-a3f6-a9c2011eed2b":{"id_":"6f6c5a61-9cab-42fa-a3f6-a9c2011eed2b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7a0bc716-fec8-4bb8-b9ad-39847351016f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"k3S3wlrBm8z/Ox+crCrd7OFbKYoHmRL1+oASHMMXb8Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cbc873c2-6943-4e47-9464-10a3bf37670b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"wH2CucT9CzSDgSEzIpWPE/s+1RSwlEJxsYQrR9LKEC0="}},"text":"This however has been a challenge since most of the coordinators do not show initiative due to over reliance on the national program on coordination and guidance and most of these NTD coordinators do not singly work on NTDs, most of them double up as other diseases focal points and or public health officers in charge of their jurisdictions. This creates a competitive role in implementation of activities on NTDs. However, the division has embarked on intensified county ownership campaign and advocacy. In western it has been able to meet up with the first ladies, MCAs and County Assembly committee on health in turn some of these counties have committed to include a budget line for NTDs in their county budget. This is a good direction towards ownership and elimination of these NTDs. Nationally the division has gone through a lot of transformation, before devolution the division had 30 satellite laboratories, they acted as regional referral centres. These were converted to clinical laboratories post devolution and the staff were redeployed to other roles in the counties. In the same line the division had most of its national lab space lost to the East African Regional Reference Laboratories. During the process of restructuring, Vector Borne Unit and Neglected Tropical Diseases Unit were split and in the process the division lost its budget line in the Ministry which led to loss of direct support from the government. The other challenge that the division faces is lack of sufficient staff, most of the staff have been lost to either attrition or death leaving the division lean to fully cover the NTDs endemic in the country. The last time the Ministry recruited was in 2012 and previously in 1987, resulting in a huge transition gap and little knowledge on management. The division currently relies heavily on donor funding, this creates the need for government ownership and inclusion of a budget line for DVBNTDs within the Ministry, increase staff capacity through recruitments and inclusion of some NTD interventions in the Cabinet Secretary’s performance contract.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8a/dBlpZHJhQYtMY7ET+zz7lb4bmaWzGiVV/mMerXVI="},"cbc873c2-6943-4e47-9464-10a3bf37670b":{"id_":"cbc873c2-6943-4e47-9464-10a3bf37670b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6f6c5a61-9cab-42fa-a3f6-a9c2011eed2b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"8a/dBlpZHJhQYtMY7ET+zz7lb4bmaWzGiVV/mMerXVI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"63fac28b-6eac-42df-95ff-359f1dc5a332","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"5wzC+Pat9diJJmFx4al9bBJm4SeSw7Xaa3/C32IP2z0="}},"text":"**Table 37: Summary of Details Sub-Activities for Pillar 4**\n|Activity|Description|Responsible Unit|Timeline|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Activity 1|Description of activity 1|Unit 1|Timeline 1|\n|Activity 2|Description of activity 2|Unit 2|Timeline 2|\n|Activity 3|Description of activity 3|Unit 3|Timeline 3|\n---\n# Table 37: Pillar 4 -

This part of the NTD master plan 2023-2027 establishes the resource outlay required to implement the plan on an annual basis, as well as strategic priorities and initiatives outlined by the Division of Vector Borne & Neglected Tropical Diseases in the ministry of health, across partners and stakeholders. This chapter presents cost estimates for providing health care services under the NTD master plan. It also describes in detail the level of resource requirements for the strategic plan period 2023-2027, the available resources and the gap between what is anticipated and what is required. The process of estimating resources is a critical component toward sustainable financing of NTDs and is used as a tool for resource mobilization on the funding gap needed to implement the interventions outlined in the Kenya NTD master plan. Ultimately, the end goal is to support the realization of the strategic priorities and initiatives. Basically, this information on costs, resources available and the financing gap is expected to assist stakeholders to develop realistic annual health budgets. Without this, annual operational plans cannot be designed or implemented in a more effective way. The results will help health program implementers, policy makers, and funders generate evidence to support advocacy efforts for NTD services and resource mobilization. It will also improve NTD resource allocation, planning, budgeting, monitoring, review, and delivery performance. The information from the analyses will be important for developing investment cases and facilitating the calculation of the health and economic impact of NTD interventions. # 4.2 Costing Methodology\n\nCosting is a process of determining the value of inputs required to generate a particular output in monetary terms. It involves estimating the quantity of inputs required by an activity/programme. It is also described as a quantitative process, which involves estimating both operational (recurrent) costs and capital costs of a programme. The process ensures that the value of resources required to deliver services is cost-effective and affordable. The study used Activity Based Costing approach (ABC), a bottom-up costing approach to cost the NTD master plan. Activity-based costing (ABC) is a method of allocating costs to products and services based on each intervention and activity with an aim of achieving set goals/results. ---\n# ABC is generally used as a tool for planning and control. All costs of activities are traced to the product or service for which the activities are performed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5wzC+Pat9diJJmFx4al9bBJm4SeSw7Xaa3/C32IP2z0="},"6059e522-1727-497e-b62f-cc832c04d48d":{"id_":"6059e522-1727-497e-b62f-cc832c04d48d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"b0W98fes0lKRmQId3KPAxyolhwnzLNcKvAQxDhjeZ9M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"63fac28b-6eac-42df-95ff-359f1dc5a332","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"5wzC+Pat9diJJmFx4al9bBJm4SeSw7Xaa3/C32IP2z0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"27b7077f-b209-471a-901d-aa02f7bcdff4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf","file_name":"DtW_NTD Masterplan 2023-2027.pdf"},"hash":"EuwZt3RyAEbcT9nocup0fvqZcNcrkIBXNCnwvM6q3LE="}},"text":"All costs of activities are traced to the product or service for which the activities are performed. Direct labour and materials are relatively easy to trace directly to products. In ABC, each of the activities requires inputs, such as labour, conference hall etc. These inputs are required in certain quantities, and with certain frequencies. The summation of the product of the unit cost, the quantity, and the frequency of the input will give the total input cost. Unit cost refers to the value of resources to provide a service to one unit/person (client or a patient). In activity-based costing all the ingredients to provide a service to one person are clearly defined. The quantity of each input (ingredient) in the provision of the service is required. The cost price of a unit of the input is also required for the calculation of the unit cost. The ABC costing method was used to estimate the resources required for the strategic pillars, priorities and activities within the master plan. The scope for these strategic priorities and initiatives costed in the ABC is for all the NTDs that are endemic in the country. # 4.3 Total Resource Requirements (2023 – 2027)\n\nThe cost estimates show that DVBNTD and other key stakeholders require an investment of KSh 79,318.85 million for NTDs over the 5-year plan period. These costs include the cost of implementing activities within the strategic pillars. These activities are cross-cutting across all the NTDs that are endemic in the country.

In Kenya, the NTD program is over-reliant on external financing from development partners and other stakeholders. The Division of Vector-Borne & Neglected Tropical Diseases conducted a resource mapping assessment to determine the resources available for the implementation of the master plan. The financing gap was estimated by generating the difference between the projected available resources and the cost of implementing the NTD master plan. The results are in Figure 38. The DVBNTD faces a financing gap of Ksh 73,598.60 million over the 5-year period. The gap is highest in FY 2024/25 at Ksh 15,193.48 million and lowest in FY 2026/27 at Ksh 13,725.53 million. The huge financing gap is driven by potentially declining external financing and the increasing burden of neglected tropical diseases. # Figure 38: Financial Gap Analysis For The NTD Master Plan (Ksh Millions)\n\n|Fiscal Year|Resources Required|Resource Available|Funding Gap|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|FY 2022/23|15,112.91|1,079.54|16,192.45|\n|FY 2023/24|15,066.52|1,096.88|16,163.41|\n|FY 2024/25|15,193.48|1,160.33|16,353.81|\n|FY 2025/26|14,500.15|1,191.75|15,691.90|\n|FY 2026/27|13,725.53|1,191.75|14,917.28|\n|Total|73,598.60|5,720.26|79,318.85|\n\nIt is anticipated that the government, partners and donors that are currently supporting the NTD programmes will continue providing their assistance towards achieving the targets for the four pillars and strategic priorities.

The effective respondent tracking rate was 84%. Individuals who received 2 to 3 additional years of childhood deworming experience an increase of 14% in consumption expenditure, 13% in hourly earnings, 9% in non-agricultural work hours, and are 9% more likely to live in urban areas. Most effects are concentrated among males and older individuals. Given deworming’s low cost, a conservative annualized social internal rate of return estimate is 37%. # Authors' Affiliations\n\nHicks: University of Oklahoma, jhamoryhicks@ou.edu; Miguel: University of California, Berkeley & NBER, emiguel@berkeley.edu; Walker: University of California, Berkeley, mwwalker@berkeley.edu; Kremer: Harvard University & NBER, mkremer@fas.harvard.edu; Baird: George Washington University, sbaird@gwu.edu. # Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Kevin Audi, Lauren Falcao Bergquist, Stephanie Bonds, Christina Brown, Lorenzo Casaburi, Lisa Chen, Evan DeFilippis, Madeline Duhon, Anton Heil, Jonas Hjort, Luna Yue Huang, Maryam Janani, Daniel Kannell, Anne Karing, Michelle Layvant, Andrew Fischer Lees, Runjiu Liu, Layna Lowe, Leah Luben, Ronald Malaki, Jamie McCasland, Eric Ochieng, Matt Pecenco, Kristianna Post, Adina Rom, Jon Schellenberg, Noor Sethi, Nachiket Shah, Emaan Siddique, Somara Sobharwal, Changcheng Song, Emma Smith, Jonas Tungodden, and Paula Vinchery, among others, for providing excellent research assistance on the KLPS project.

Yet there remains limited evidence on the causal impacts of child health gains on adult living standards, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While there has been some recent progress in wealthy countries (Almond, Currie, and Duque 2018, Hendren and Sprung-Keyser 2020), few studies in LMICs are able to exploit credibly exogenous variation in child health status, combined with long-term participant tracking and detailed adult outcome measures.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7qqCy6ixdnP/UTndW7wUBp3ES1j4XisYD5lvRxth9xQ="},"a51c9556-f7d4-4839-84bf-a17d896ab15e":{"id_":"a51c9556-f7d4-4839-84bf-a17d896ab15e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"335027bf-365c-4c3e-a283-5a007a94ebbd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"7qqCy6ixdnP/UTndW7wUBp3ES1j4XisYD5lvRxth9xQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1e8f0cc3-ee92-4492-8b23-bb61a19f8462","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"yZu/P6T80WRigmJlkaaDN6oKkAeu7uFrG8tHazf4aSo="}},"text":"This is in part due to the lack of high-quality administrative data on workers, as well as widespread participation in the informal sector and subsistence agriculture.1\n\n# This study contributes new evidence that addresses leading methodological concerns\n\nFirst, we exploit exogenous variation in child health via a randomized health intervention (the Primary School Deworming Project, PSDP) that provided deworming treatment to Kenyan children. Starting in 1998, 50 schools that we term the treatment group received 2 to 3 years of additional deworming relative to the 25 control group schools. Second, we estimate impacts on individual living standards up to 20 years later, using data from the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), which we designed to follow a representative sample of PSDP participants. Specifically, we utilize a detailed consumption questionnaire, considered the gold-standard of living standards measurement in LMICs, and gather rich information on adult labor and earnings, including in the informal sector and subsistence agriculture. Third, we successfully survey respondents over time: at the 20 year follow-up (round 4, 2017-19), the effective respondent survey rate was 84% among those still alive, with rates balanced across treatment arms; rates were similarly high in the 10-year (round 2, 2007-09) and 15-year (round 3, 2011-14) rounds. This is in part due to the decision to track migrants beyond the original study region, to other parts of Kenya, East Africa, and beyond. # In our main analysis\n\nWe find those in the deworming treatment group experience a 14% gain in consumption expenditures (p-value < 0.10), 7% increase in total earnings, and a 13% gain in hourly earnings (p-value < 0.10) during the period 10 to 20 years after the start of treatment. There are also shifts in sectors of residence and employment: treatment group individuals are 9% more likely to live in urban areas (p-value < 0.05), and experience a 9% increase in non-agricultural work hours (p-value < 0.05). Effects are concentrated among males (though we typically cannot reject equal effects across genders), and impacts are also typically larger for individuals who are older (those above age 12 at baseline); below we return to interpretation of these patterns.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5IuKX2xG52PP1xJyyR4+SURM6uUqycUBWdV36GEOIm8="},"1e8f0cc3-ee92-4492-8b23-bb61a19f8462":{"id_":"1e8f0cc3-ee92-4492-8b23-bb61a19f8462","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a51c9556-f7d4-4839-84bf-a17d896ab15e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"5IuKX2xG52PP1xJyyR4+SURM6uUqycUBWdV36GEOIm8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"92e00dcd-6999-4779-bd50-ab77efad7c5a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"lZmvljUhK4PtDVMX4Ihz9Rz9l1atUagW7m1Oc2owJvw="}},"text":"The observed consumption and earnings benefits,\n\n# Footnotes\n\n1.

Bouguen et al. (2019) finds few studies of development interventions with more than a 7 year follow-up. ---\ntogether with deworming’s low cost when distributed at scale, imply that a conservative estimate of its annualized social internal rate of return is 37%, a high return by any standard. # 1. Background\n\nAs background, intestinal helminth infections are widespread, infecting one in five people worldwide (Pullan et al. 2014), and have adverse health and nutritional consequences for children, including stunted growth, weakness, and anemia (Stephenson et al. 1993; Stoltzfus et al. 1997; Guyatt et al. 2001; Silva et al. 2004; Disease Control Priorities Project 2008). The infections also may have broader immunological effects, for instance, by making individuals more prone to other infections such as malaria (Kirwan et al. 2010; Wammes et al. 2016) and altering the gut microbiome (Guernier et al. 2017; Zaiss and Harris 2016); worm infections in pregnant mothers may also reduce child birthweight (Larocque et al. 2006). These adverse health effects form the basis for the World Health Organization’s (WHO) long-standing recommendation to provide mass school-based treatment in regions with infection prevalence above 20% (WHO 1992; 2017). Mass treatment is attractive because common deworming drugs are safe and cost less than US$1 per year per child, while diagnosing infections (through stool sample analysis) is imprecise and far more expensive (Ahuja et al. 2015). # 2. Debate on Recommendations\n\nThe appropriateness of this recommendation has been actively debated following a survey article that claimed few population-wide child gains from mass treatment (Taylor-Robinson et al. 2012). However, a recent meta-analysis incorporating more studies finds larger positive and significant impacts on child weight, height and mid-upper arm circumference (Croke et al. 2016).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yZu/P6T80WRigmJlkaaDN6oKkAeu7uFrG8tHazf4aSo="},"92e00dcd-6999-4779-bd50-ab77efad7c5a":{"id_":"92e00dcd-6999-4779-bd50-ab77efad7c5a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1e8f0cc3-ee92-4492-8b23-bb61a19f8462","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"yZu/P6T80WRigmJlkaaDN6oKkAeu7uFrG8tHazf4aSo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4ef0688f-29dc-4e8b-87a9-b357f47942bc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"3oGLd3LQZfUC5S4nOPKZ0QXEn0m4uXwunanQg6yLiH8="}},"text":"2016). There is little evidence regarding long-run economic impacts, with the exception of Bleakley (2007), which finds that deworming in the U.S. South in the early 20th century led to higher adult educational attainment and income. # 3. Analysis of the PSDP Experiment\n\nSeveral studies analyze the PSDP experiment. Miguel and Kremer (2004) find improvements in child school participation in treatment schools over the first two years of the program, with absenteeism falling by one quarter. They also estimate sizeable treatment externalities, presumably as treatment kills off worms already in the body, reducing transmission to others in the community; in particular, they document reductions in worm infection rates among both untreated children attending treatment schools, and children attending other schools located within 4 km of the treatment schools.2 Ozier (2018) provides further evidence on externalities, showing that young children living in the treatment communities – who were not yet school aged and thus did not themselves receive deworming – experienced gains in learning outcomes up to ten years later, equivalent to 0.5 years of schooling on average. The current study most directly builds on Baird et al. (2016), which documented deworming. # 4. Footnotes\n\n2.

Baird et al. (2016) was subject to several limitations that the current study was designed to address. First, because many respondents were still in school at the 10 year follow-up, estimation of some labor market effects was necessarily conducted on selected samples. Second, only partial information was collected on subsistence agricultural production. Third, consumption data was not available for that round, leading to a reliance on a proxy (meals eaten).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lZmvljUhK4PtDVMX4Ihz9Rz9l1atUagW7m1Oc2owJvw="},"4ef0688f-29dc-4e8b-87a9-b357f47942bc":{"id_":"4ef0688f-29dc-4e8b-87a9-b357f47942bc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"92e00dcd-6999-4779-bd50-ab77efad7c5a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"lZmvljUhK4PtDVMX4Ihz9Rz9l1atUagW7m1Oc2owJvw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"319d3511-e893-4868-bfac-0921fc0eec5f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"GVBsDra+qEdUzv605RtABeCFTTmOdit8yQYUNhA0TyU="}},"text":"The current paper makes several novel contributions.

The measurement of economic outcomes was also improved: KLPS round 4 incorporates a detailed consumption expenditure questionnaire (modeled on the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey, LSMS, see Grosh and Glewwe 2000) for all respondents, and round 3 collected this for a representative subsample. Both KLPS rounds 3 and 4 also contain improved measures of agricultural productivity, including in subsistence agriculture, which, combined with other measures, provides a measure of total household earnings. Finally, while earlier PSDP deworming cost-benefit analyses were necessarily speculative, our use of long-run follow-up data means the calculations here are based almost entirely on observed outcomes. # 1 Data and Estimation Strategy\n\n# 1.1 Program Background and Data Collection\n\nThe PSDP study area is Busia District (since renamed Busia County), a largely agrarian region in western Kenya that is fairly representative of rural Kenya in terms of living standards. At the start of the program in 1998, the vast majority of children attended primary school, but dropout rates were high in grades 6, 7 and 8 (the final three years) and fewer than half went on to secondary school. Secondary schooling rates increased dramatically in the region over the next decade. Among adults, occupational and family roles continue to differ markedly by gender. This segmentation makes it plausible that the impacts of a health intervention could differ by gender, for instance, as hypothesized in Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan (2012), who argue that child health gains in low-income, “brawn-based” economies. ---\n# may translate into greater labor market gains for males. In 1998 a non-governmental organization (NGO) launched the PSDP in two geographic divisions of Busia, in 75 schools enrolling over 32,000 pupils.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3oGLd3LQZfUC5S4nOPKZ0QXEn0m4uXwunanQg6yLiH8="},"319d3511-e893-4868-bfac-0921fc0eec5f":{"id_":"319d3511-e893-4868-bfac-0921fc0eec5f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4ef0688f-29dc-4e8b-87a9-b357f47942bc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"3oGLd3LQZfUC5S4nOPKZ0QXEn0m4uXwunanQg6yLiH8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5a2c5f14-1976-4e33-aff2-af31cda23933","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"b9EdvS1DucQxWastDtkjy24HWdU9j3/Of7U9axh4nQo="}},"text":"Baseline parasitological surveys indicated that helminth infection rates were over 90%, and over a third had a moderate-heavy infection according to a modified WHO infection criteria (Miguel and Kremer 2004).3 The 75 schools were experimentally divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were first stratified by administrative sub-unit (zone), zones were listed alphabetically within each geographic division, and schools were then listed in order of pupil enrollment within each zone, with every third school assigned to a given program group. The three treatment groups were well-balanced along baseline characteristics (see Miguel and Kremer 2004, Baird et al. 2016 and Appendix Figure A.1 for project details). Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into deworming treatment during 1998-2001: Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming and health education in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, and Group 3 in 2001. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools were thus on average assigned 2.41 more years of deworming than Group 3 children; these two early beneficiary groups are denoted the treatment group here, following Baird et al. (2016). Drug take-up rates were high, at approximately 75% in the treatment group, and under 5% in the control group (Miguel and Kremer 2004). The Kenya Life Panel Survey was launched in 2003 to track a representative sample of approximately 7,500 respondents enrolled in grades 2-7 in the PSDP schools at baseline. During round 1 (2003-2005), sample respondents were still mainly teenagers and few were active in the labor market; the subsequent survey rounds collected between 2007 and 2019 are the focus of this study. From the start, KLPS enumerators have traveled throughout Kenya and beyond to interview respondents (Appendix Figure A.2). The spread of mobile phones in Kenya during the study period has greatly facilitated tracking, and as a result, the effective tracking rate has remained high across KLPS rounds (Appendix Table A.1).4 In KLPS-4, 87% were found and 83.9% surveyed among those still alive (Panel A, column 1).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GVBsDra+qEdUzv605RtABeCFTTmOdit8yQYUNhA0TyU="},"5a2c5f14-1976-4e33-aff2-af31cda23933":{"id_":"5a2c5f14-1976-4e33-aff2-af31cda23933","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"319d3511-e893-4868-bfac-0921fc0eec5f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"GVBsDra+qEdUzv605RtABeCFTTmOdit8yQYUNhA0TyU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4672cab4-37bf-4259-ae16-fca35ff9e045","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"mNgY1yf/CYMqYH3yb9RUkRF79fkR09QadLnRuh45/iU="}},"text":"Rates are similar and not statistically significantly different across the treatment and control groups, and the same holds by gender (columns 4-6) and among those above and below median age (specifically, baseline age 12, Table A.2).

First, in 2001 the NGO required cost-sharing contributions from parents in a randomly selected half of the Group 1 and Group 2 schools, reducing deworming drug take-up from 75% to 18% (Appendix Figure A.1); Group 3 schools received free deworming treatment in 2001. In 2002-2003, the NGO again provided free deworming in all 75 schools (Kremer and Miguel 2007). We estimate the effect of this temporary reduction in deworming on later outcomes. Second, in early 2009, approximately 1,500 individuals in the KLPS sample additionally took part in a vocational training voucher RCT prior to the start of the KLPS-3, and a subset of these also took part in a randomized cash grant program prior to KLPS-4; 1,070 of these individuals were randomly selected to receive a training voucher and/or cash grant.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"b9EdvS1DucQxWastDtkjy24HWdU9j3/Of7U9axh4nQo="},"4672cab4-37bf-4259-ae16-fca35ff9e045":{"id_":"4672cab4-37bf-4259-ae16-fca35ff9e045","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a2c5f14-1976-4e33-aff2-af31cda23933","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"b9EdvS1DucQxWastDtkjy24HWdU9j3/Of7U9axh4nQo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dd48e039-fb34-49ac-bcd3-705355a75bf7","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"ldkQsmzUBHVq7b0w7J1hyfdgIptN7MfrmgYsXSFdRqU="}},"text":"To focus the present analysis on deworming impacts, and avoid possible interactions with other programs, these individuals are dropped from the analysis for survey rounds after their assignment to the other treatments. The randomly assigned voucher and cash control group (non-recipient) individuals are retained throughout, and given greater weight in the econometric analysis to maintain the representativeness of the original PSDP sample. # 1.2 Estimation strategy\n\nThe analytical approach builds on Baird et al. (2016) and follows our pre-analysis plan (PAP) (Baird et al. 2017). We exploit the PSDP’s experimental research design, namely, that the program exogenously provided individuals in treatment schools (Groups 1 and 2) two to three additional years of deworming. We focus on intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates for two main reasons: first, since treatment compliance was relatively high, and second, because previous research shows that untreated individuals within treatment communities experienced gains (Miguel and Kremer 2004), complicating estimation of treatment effects on the treated (TOT) within schools. The analysis focuses on two main approaches, namely: i) pooled regressions that use data from KLPS rounds 2, 3 and 4 to estimate the overall long-run deworming effects 10 to 20 years after treatment, and ii) regressions using only KLPS-4, the longest-term follow-up. These two approaches, as well as the main outcome measures, were pre-specified in Baird et al. (2017) prior to conducting any analyses on the KLPS-4 data. The first approach has the advantage of utilizing all possible data, including information on the vocational training and cash grant recipients (who are dropped from the later rounds, as noted above), and is specifically, vocational training voucher winners are dropped from both the KLPS rounds 3 and 4 analysis, and cash grant winners dropped from round 4; those interventions are studied in separate work.

The pre-specified main coefficient of interest is λ1, which captures gains accruing to individuals in the 50 treatment schools relative to the 25 control schools. Since deworming was assigned by school rather than at the individual level, some of the gains in treatment schools are likely due to within-school externalities. This is an attractive coefficient to focus on since it is a lower bound on the overall effect of deworming in the presence of cross-school treatment externalities, as shown in Baird et al. (2016)7. The vector Xij,0 of individual and school covariates includes baseline school characteristics (average test score, population, number of students within 6 km, and administrative zone indicators), baseline individual characteristics (gender and grade), indicators for the KLPS survey calendar month, wave and round, and an indicator for the vocational training and cash grant control group. Estimates are weighted to maintain representativeness with the baseline PSDP population, taking into account the sampling for KLPS, the two-stage tracking methodology, and inclusion in the vocational training and cash grant program. Finally, εijt is the error term clustered at the school level, allowing for correlation in outcomes both across individuals in those schools and across survey rounds. We consider two secondary sources of exogenous variation in exposure to deworming, namely, the 2001 cost-sharing school indicator, Cj ∈ {0, 1}, and the proportion of students in neighboring schools within 6 km that received deworming, Pj ∈ [0, 1], which we call local deworming saturation. While not the main focus, Appendix B presents evidence on their effects on outcomes.

(2016) show that those older than 12 at baseline experienced larger gains in terms of hours worked, meals eaten, and non-agricultural earnings, a finding they attribute to the fact that these individuals – who were at least 22 by KLPS-2 – had largely completed their schooling while younger individuals had not. The hypothesis that differential age effects were driven by school enrollment patterns led us to postulate in the PAP that there would be only minimal age differences in impacts by KLPS-4, as only 3% of the sample was still enrolled in school then.

Effects on consumption are larger in magnitude for male (USD PPP 513, p-value < 0.10) than female respondents (USD PPP 89) in both absolute and percentage terms (Panel A, cols. 2 and 3), although the gender difference is not significant at traditional levels. Women also have far lower average consumption, a pattern mirrored for all living standards and labor market measures, and likely indicative of the limited economic opportunities open to many women in Kenya.11 Consumption effects are also far larger for older individuals (those older than 12 at baseline, who were typically 32 to 36 years old by KLPS-4), at USD PPP 886 (col. 4, p-value < 0.01), an effect that remains significant at traditional levels accounting for the false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (Anderson 2008).

Note that those without any reported earnings in the last year are included in the analysis as zeros. To be sure we are focusing on individual labor productivity, we first only include farming profits in activities (e.g., growing a particular crop) for which the respondent reported providing all household labor hours. This measure thus misses agricultural profits derived from activities to which the respondent contributed jointly with other household members. The data indicate that 70% of agricultural activities are in fact conducted jointly with others, making it challenging to confidently assess individual agricultural productivity; this is a well-known concern in development economics. We later present a measure of total household income per capita that includes all household agricultural profits as well as earnings generated by the respondent and other adult household members.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Zbsp98pmmz+xBSMJJclvztoLSQq+WMJhwwvVeI4GRqI="},"bb68b3d1-3f72-4b64-a209-8ced30332406":{"id_":"bb68b3d1-3f72-4b64-a209-8ced30332406","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b8cc8495-6c93-46c0-9700-47a3574eaf48","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"Zbsp98pmmz+xBSMJJclvztoLSQq+WMJhwwvVeI4GRqI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"026ff32f-98bc-4f7c-a547-4eca62de6629","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"kebrErluFxDwclwz9QdJiJsyGjIErCR3N9KEVwjOn6A="}},"text":"Across the 10 to 20 year follow-up rounds, individual earnings are USD PPP 80 (s.e. 11).

The estimated treatment effect is quite stable across survey round 2 (USD PPP 87), round 3 (USD PPP 83) and round 4 (USD PPP 85, see Appendix Figure A.4), although none are statistically significant. The effect falls as a percentage of the control mean across rounds, as average earnings rise over time. The increase in the confidence interval surrounding estimates from rounds 2 through 4 also appear likely to be driven by the growth in both the mean and variability of earnings as individuals move into their prime working years.

Here we briefly discuss potential explanations for this heterogeneity, and what it suggests about the mechanisms underlying long-run impacts. It is puzzling that females show fewer economic benefits than males since they experience larger gains in schooling attainment, test scores, and self-reported health than males (Baird et al. 2016 and Appendix Table A.11, Panel B). A possible explanation is that these human capital gains alone may be insufficient in a context where many women face important constraints and fewer economic opportunities than men (USAID 2020).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kebrErluFxDwclwz9QdJiJsyGjIErCR3N9KEVwjOn6A="},"bdcd2b46-cbf5-4f86-b7ac-a5f2d73aed66":{"id_":"bdcd2b46-cbf5-4f86-b7ac-a5f2d73aed66","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"026ff32f-98bc-4f7c-a547-4eca62de6629","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"kebrErluFxDwclwz9QdJiJsyGjIErCR3N9KEVwjOn6A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5c43c014-be56-4eea-b6ec-ac0f37d0e1f3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"Lg+W6mLCVP2+wQo06jkOXHG6ZVL16m658/ff+ypdiSQ="}},"text":"For instance, KLPS sample women spend roughly three times more hours than men doing household chores and more than twice as much time providing childcare, and their participation in the non-agricultural labor force is far lower (Appendix Table A.10, Panel C). The larger estimated gains among older participants may also be surprising at first given an intuitive sense that younger children might gain more from human capital investments, but note that all sample individuals are already outside of hypothesized “critical” windows of early childhood development (Appendix Table A.10, Panel A). One piece of evidence that could help explain the age pattern is the finding that deworming led to larger human capital gains among older individuals. Older individuals in the control group have lower levels of schooling than younger individuals (Appendix Table A.10, Panel C), but the deworming effect for the older group is +0.45 years of schooling (s.e. 0.18, p-value ă 0.05, Appendix Table A.11, Panel B), while for younger individuals it is closer to zero (+0.04 years). While schooling gains alone are not sufficient to guarantee later labor market benefits – as demonstrated by the experience of females – they are plausibly driving some of the long-run impacts. Urban residence was included as an outcome in the later Baird et al. (2019) PAP, as we collect more a more detailed migration history as part of ongoing survey modules relative to the data utilized in this paper. This reflects the rapid increase in schooling over the decade following the start of PSDP. ---\n# 3 Rate of return and fiscal impacts of deworming\n\nHere we present deworming cost-effectiveness estimates (see Appendix D for details). The social net present value (NPV) of providing free deworming treatment takes into account the cost of deworming medication, the cost of additional schooling resulting from deworming (Baird et al. 2016), and economic gains measured via consumption or earnings. Since deworming was assigned at the school level, changes in social networks could also be a channel. We find that older individuals in the treatment group are indeed more likely to learn of a job through a primary school classmate (+6 percentage points on a base of 13%, p-value ≤ 0.05, Appendix Table A.11), suggesting this could also be a partial explanation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4JqAULyE3nP9sBEul3c1uIwkmynugJcXynrac8M2hsI="},"5c43c014-be56-4eea-b6ec-ac0f37d0e1f3":{"id_":"5c43c014-be56-4eea-b6ec-ac0f37d0e1f3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bdcd2b46-cbf5-4f86-b7ac-a5f2d73aed66","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"4JqAULyE3nP9sBEul3c1uIwkmynugJcXynrac8M2hsI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"abd109ab-f4df-4b18-afbb-864093f232c2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"D1G3sJ07/0BgWwoTXqhLRd0+R0w0ME/UBDx6670BQks="}},"text":"A more speculative explanation is that the level of deworming treatment is playing a role. While the average difference in assigned years of deworming between treatment and control schools is the same for younger and older cohorts (Appendix Table A.10), the distributions are different, and in particular the average years of assigned treatment in the control group is far higher among younger individuals (Appendix Table A.11), as many older control group students graduate from (or leave) primary school before receiving any deworming (Appendix Figure A.5, Panels B and C). If the marginal benefit of deworming is declining with each additional year of treatment (leading to a concave functional form), this could lead treatment effects to be larger among the older subgroup. For the primary consumption per-capita outcome, treatment effects are (reassuringly) monotonically increasing with additional years of deworming treatment assignment, and there is some evidence of concavity, especially at greater than 4 years (Panel A). While promising, this explanation remains tentative given limited epidemiological evidence on the deworming dose response function. We are also able to rule out several alternative explanations for differential treatment effects, see Appendix C. The most obvious explanation for heterogeneous effects would be differential baseline worm infection levels across subgroups, or varying degrees of infection reduction, but we do not find meaningful differences along these lines by gender or age (Appendix Tables A.10, A.11). Nor did Baird et al. (2016) estimate significant differences in impacts as a function of baseline local area infection levels, although this latter analysis is somewhat statistically under-powered. The differential gains by age do not appear to be due to life cycle or age-at-survey explanations, but instead are driven by cohort effects (Appendix Table A.9). There are differences in average levels of parental education across older and younger cohorts, but little evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects by level of parental education (Appendix Table A.8). ---\n# Figure 1\n\ndisplays these components graphically, where the direct costs are illustrated in the darkest gray in the first years.

For earnings, we assume these gains start 10 years after deworming treatment, roughly coinciding with entry into adulthood and KLPS round 2. Since we do not have consumption data until KLPS-3, we conservatively assume that the average estimated effect from KLPS 3 and 4 only pertains during the period from 15 to 25 years after treatment. We also make the conservative assumption, presented graphically in Figure 1, that effects last for five years, roughly the time between survey rounds, and fall to zero five years after round 4 (at t = 25). The main estimates use an annual discount rate of 10%, the median real interest rate in Kenya during 1998-2018, which is conservative if other potential funders (e.g., international donors) face lower rates. We also compute the internal rate of return (IRR). The dotted horizontal line in Figure 1 shows the magnitude of average annual treatment effects needed to attain an annualized IRR of 10% is USD PPP 7.99. We also calculate the NPV and IRR of additional government tax revenue generated by deworming by multiplying earnings or consumption gains by the average Kenyan tax rate. The estimated deworming consumption and earnings gains are both an order of magnitude larger than the USD PPP 7.99 needed to attain the social IRR of 10% noted above (Figure 1, Appendix Table A.12), and are also far larger than the gains needed to attain a fiscal IRR of 10% (USD PPP 29.12 and 48.21, respectively, Appendix Table A.12). The social and fiscal NPV estimates are positive for both the consumption and earnings effects, and for annual discount rates of 10%. In the most conservative scenario, focusing on earnings gains and the 10% discount over 25 years, the social NPV is USD PPP 230.71 and the fiscal NPV is USD PPP 16.74 (Panel B).

Individuals who received deworming as children experience substantial increases in adult consumption, hourly earnings, non-agricultural employment, and urban residence. These findings add to growing evidence that the Primary School Deworming Project had meaningful positive effects on recipients (Miguel and Kremer 2004; Baird et al. 2016). Even ignoring spillovers and making other conservative assumptions, the social rate of return appears to be very high. From a policy perspective, it is important to consider external validity. Intestinal worm infections are widespread globally, with high infection rates in many parts of Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, and even a possible (and unfortunate) resurgence in the rural U.S. South (McKenna et al. 2017). The ubiquity of the infections suggests that this study’s findings have relevance for many other settings. At the same time, the degree to which school-based mass deworming generates positive long-run benefits is plausibly linked to the extent of infection. The study setting featured high baseline infection prevalence, at over 90%, and a large share of children with intense infections. The PSDP intervention also began during the strong 1997-1998 El Niño–Southern Oscillation event, which brought torrential rains to the region, and the related deterioration in hygiene and sanitation likely contributed to elevated worm infection levels. Deworming treatment impacts would presumably have been smaller had worm infection levels been lower. The analysis does not resolve the issue of exactly why and through what channels deworming affected adult outcomes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hI0uGlKlAWRfWS8FAcCRsm9wQVn6w+wPRhw00grlMGE="},"b51845de-989f-4557-ac0e-8c494f0c7a82":{"id_":"b51845de-989f-4557-ac0e-8c494f0c7a82","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"026m0a13QS9HOrKg7ifPCPDgXqGsJZTJthZzyO4YMWM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"379a3efa-abaf-4eef-b1ce-5af43162d9ec","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"hI0uGlKlAWRfWS8FAcCRsm9wQVn6w+wPRhw00grlMGE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"88305279-bf71-4aa2-83bb-78d4a9fbf4cd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Twenty Year Economic Impacts of Deworming_2020.pdf"},"hash":"diXqJsS3cWqhnEovEc0ak26XthLiTtyumpzkxzXHiso="}},"text":"Since changes to health, education, social activity among schoolmates, marital choices, and income levels may all affect each other in various directions, the impacts should not be interpreted strictly as all reflecting deworming’s direct health effects, but rather are likely to be the result of a cumulative process of interaction among these factors.16 Our examination of heterogeneous treatment effects by gender and age sheds some light on the importance of certain factors, but cannot definitively adjudicate between channels. Further research is needed to understand how institutional and contextual factors interact with child health investments, to better understand mechanisms (Almond, Currie, and Duque 2018). Another area of ongoing debate is whether child health and nutrition investments must fall within a “critical” early period of development for long-term gains to accrue (Bundy et al. 2018). Our findings indicate that even health programs focused on school-age children can yield substantial benefits, consistent with recent US findings. To be clear, we do not expect that child deworming treatment would have a direct impact on respondents’ adult worm loads decades later, given worms’ relatively short average lifespan in the human body. ---\n(Hendren and Sprung-Keyser 2020). As most study participants have already also become parents themselves, another interesting future direction will be to investigate possible deworming effects on the next generation. The economic impacts we document suggest that such effects are plausible; it is also possible that the education gains experienced by women could improve life outcomes for their children. The existence of any inter-generational benefits would further bolster deworming’s cost-effectiveness. 15\n---\n# References\n\nAhuja, Amrita, Sarah Baird, Joan Hamory Hicks, Michael Kremer, Edward Miguel, and Shawn Powers. 2015. “When should governments subsidize health?

Consumption is adjusted for urban-rural price differences for respondents living in Nairobi and Mombasa. Panel B reports annual individual earnings, calculated as the sum of wage employment across all jobs; non-agricultural self-employment profit across all business; and individual farming profit, defined as net profit generated from non-crop and crop farming activities for which the respondent provided all reported household labor hours and was the main decision-maker within the last 12 months. Wage earnings and self-employment profits were collected in KLPS rounds 2, 3 and 4; agricultural profits were collected in KLPS 3 and 4. Panel C reports annual per-capita household earnings, calculated as the sum of wage employment earnings, self-employment profits, and agricultural profits across all household members, divided by the number of household members. Household earnings are only available in KLPS-4. All outcomes are converted to constant 2017 USD at PPP rates, and the top 1% of observations are trimmed.

Columns (2) through (5) report estimates separately by gender and age at baseline (older than 12, 12 or younger). Columns (2) and (3) report estimates for Female and Male are constructed from a single regression including treatment-female, cost-sharing-female, and saturation-female interaction terms. Columns (4) and (5) also report results from a single regression, using an indicator for those older than 12 at baseline and analogous interaction terms to Columns (2) and (3).

Personnel from MoEST and MoH play a joint leadership role in ensuring that the Programme is implemented in every public and private primary school within the targeted treatment area, with the goal of treating every child aged 2-14 years whether they are enrolled or not enrolled in school. With funding from the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF UK) for the first five years, the goal is to reduce prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis by routine, systematic school-based mass drug administration within the context of a long-term, evidence-based control strategy. In order to achieve this goal, the routine collection of prevalence and intensity data is critical to understand the impact of the school-based deworming programme on school children as well as the re-infection and transmission dynamics in the population to inform future evidence-based programme planning. The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) is responsible for the national parasitological data collection to monitor changes in prevalence and intensity in a sample of schools in the four provinces where treatment is being delivered. Prevalence and intensity data is collected for hookworm, *Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and Schistosomiasis mansoni using stool samples and Kato Katz method. Data for Schistosomiasis haematobium* is collected using urine filtration method. This data collection is structured in the following way:\n\n1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oDXPfKGWXwrVR8SKPEOKInetc1mDnHrQmSHkwmquDzs="},"5c3dcb41-30c5-44df-b628-c70d2524909a":{"id_":"5c3dcb41-30c5-44df-b628-c70d2524909a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"R8lxhlpQ/MYECMa3ILJMJlGOekLuDfbDmeG6aNQtApM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1fa3003b-6a8e-44f6-afc7-3189fc576ca5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"oDXPfKGWXwrVR8SKPEOKInetc1mDnHrQmSHkwmquDzs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8101861a-6d43-4a18-bf2f-abab3f463470","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"IcmDxpcW6UTX7ReagtRnbx4NOWgi4NUn6s5IvivuWO8="}},"text":"This data collection is structured in the following way:\n\n1.

The teams were easily assembled at short notice, re-trained and dispatched to the field for data collection. Supplies and reagents were also purchased in time due to the availability of reliable, timely funding. There were a few challenges to the data collection, including the unpredicted teachers’ strikes in the Fall of 2012, which delayed access to some schools for data collection. Additionally, inadequate record-keeping in schools made it difficult to get school attendance records for educational outcome data in the 10 high frequency schools and signs of reluctance to give samples in some schools (especially among the 10 schools which were visited 4 times in year for sample collection, including blood).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Tk5GwFWL38IVUVO7KbaARiSMcJSNfAtaimfUB3zaYH0="},"8101861a-6d43-4a18-bf2f-abab3f463470":{"id_":"8101861a-6d43-4a18-bf2f-abab3f463470","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"R8lxhlpQ/MYECMa3ILJMJlGOekLuDfbDmeG6aNQtApM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5c3dcb41-30c5-44df-b628-c70d2524909a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"Tk5GwFWL38IVUVO7KbaARiSMcJSNfAtaimfUB3zaYH0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"88fac02e-b6de-49f1-b77d-96dcf748173b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"RlCfYA0UUddvwHx6laGQkuDAvp/2wKUADKsZYz/vr4I="}},"text":"Otherwise, there was generally good communication across partners, including the cooperation of ministry staff.

A full discussion of the methodology and findings of the baseline are presented in the article published in the journal *Parasites & Vectors* in July of 2013. Overall, STH infection prevalence in the 200 sampled schools was 32.4% (95% CI 30.1-34.8%). A. lumbricoides was the most prevalent STH species (18.0%, 95% CI 15.7-20.6%), followed by hookworm (15.6%, 95% CI 13.7-17.7%) and then T. trichiura (6.6%, 95% CI 5.4-8.1%). The overall mean intensity of A. lumbricoides was 1,653 epg (95% CI 1372-1991), mean hookworm intensity was 64 epg (95% CI 51-81) and mean T. trichiura intensity was 33 epg (95% CI 10-104). The overall prevalence of S. mansoni was 2.1% (95% CI 1.2-3.5) with a mean infection intensity of 12 epg (95% CI 4-36). In the Coast Province, where urine samples were collected in 33 schools, the prevalence of S. haematobium was 14.8% (95% CI 11.3-19.5) and the mean infection intensity was 16 eggs/10 ml urine (95% CI 10-26). Going forwards, this same prevalence and intensity data will be collected in 200 schools in year 3 and in year 5 (midline and endline). These numbers present the average across the four provinces, further detail on province and species-specific baseline prevalence and intensity can be found in the published article.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IcmDxpcW6UTX7ReagtRnbx4NOWgi4NUn6s5IvivuWO8="},"88fac02e-b6de-49f1-b77d-96dcf748173b":{"id_":"88fac02e-b6de-49f1-b77d-96dcf748173b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"R8lxhlpQ/MYECMa3ILJMJlGOekLuDfbDmeG6aNQtApM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8101861a-6d43-4a18-bf2f-abab3f463470","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"IcmDxpcW6UTX7ReagtRnbx4NOWgi4NUn6s5IvivuWO8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"361653ce-32d2-4223-a904-637e04dbf07a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y1 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2013.pdf"},"hash":"iewm4DItdMcrPhiA5BqWEvDxklAalciimVukC9sKlOs="}},"text":"# Prevalence and Intensity Pre/Post Treatment in 60 Schools\n\nPrevalence and intensity of all three STH species and both schistosomiasis species was collected both before and after the first year deworming treatment in 60 of the 200 baseline schools in Western, Nyanza, Rift and Coast Provinces.

In these 10 schools, data collection for prevalence and intensity was collected at four time points. Prevalence and intensity of all three STH species and both schistosomiasis species was collected both before and after the mass drug administration in the first year. The purpose of this high frequency sample was to quantify seasonality and re-infection, and to attempt to establish causation. All schools in this sample had prevalence and intensity data collected for at least one pre-treatment time point. The number of pre and post treatment data collection time points varies across provinces due accessibility of schools for testing due to holidays and school closures and the programme roll-out schedule, with some provinces receiving treatment later in the year.

Second, according to the analysis, there were no moderate-to-heavy infections in the sampled schools in Coast province at all. This makes estimates further under-powered, since low-intensity infections are harder to measure. As the prevalence data shows, STH prevalence in the Coast seems to have dropped sharply prior to the arrival of the school deworming programme. This suggests that either seasonality is of a surprisingly large magnitude or that the lymphatic filariasis programme may have been ongoing in the area and had an impact on STH prevalence in school-children prior to treatment by this programme. There are some additional difficult-to-explain phenomena in the data: one school in Nyanza, for example, has some cases of all four species of STH in the pre-treatment period; it has no infections of any kind in the post-treatment period. Page 14 of 21\n---\n# Conclusions\n\nOverall, the results from the parasitological data collection in the first year have provided us with a useful set of data to inform the National School-Based Deworming Programme. The baseline data collected demonstrated the need for a national deworming programme to address the high burden of hookworm, *A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura* and schistosomiasis across Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces of Kenya. The pre/post data found a widespread reduction of prevalence and intensity of the three STH and two schistome species in the majority of the surveyed districts, demonstrating both the efficacy of the deworming drugs as well as the effectiveness of the programme to deliver treatment and reduce worm prevalence and intensity at a large-scale. The high frequency sample demonstrated an unexpected variability in individual worm burden dynamics and the prevalence and intensity ranges across provinces and seasons, including re-infection rates.

provinces. The impact of the Kenyan school-based deworming will be monitored in a five year (2012-2017) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programme including pre-post intervention and repeated cross-sectional surveys as outlined in Figure 1.

the Y2 pre-MDA survey, S. mansoni infections were overall low with a prevalence of 2.7% (95%CI 0.9-8.0) and an average intensity of 15 epg (95%CI 3-71). School level S. mansoni prevalence ranged from 0-86.1%. This compares to a prevalence of 1.8% (95%CI 0.5-6.0) and an average intensity of infection of 6 epg (95%CI 1-33) in the Y1 baseline survey. Y1 treatment was delivered only in Coast Province where the baseline S. mansoni prevalence and intensity were of 0.1% (95%CI 0.0-0.4) and 0 epg (95%CI 0-0) respectively. Y2 pre-MDA prevalence and intensity of infection in Coast were of 4.4% (95%CI 2.4-8.2) and 0 epg (95%CI 0-0); the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.999 and p=0.843). In the Y2 post-MDA survey, after treatment delivery in Western, Rift Valley, Nyanza and Coast Province, overall S. mansoni prevalence and average intensity dropped to 0.6% (95%CI 0.1-2.5) and 2 epg (95%CI 0-9), respectively. This means a 77.2% (95%CI 63.3-85.8) reduction in prevalence and an 88.3% (95%CI 85.6-90.5) reduction in intensity of infection. School level prevalence in the Y2 post-MDA survey ranged from 0-25.9%.

S. haematobium infections in 9 schools in Coast Province in Kilifi and Kwale Counties. In the Y2 pre-MDA survey, S. haematobium prevalence was of 10.5% (95%CI 6.1-18.2) and an average intensity of 8 eggs/10ml urine (95%CI 4-16). School level S. haematobium prevalence ranged from 1.0-24.9%. This compares to a prevalence of 18.0% (95%CI 12.6-25.6) and an average intensity of infection of 14 eggs/10ml urine (95%CI 7-30) in the Y1 baseline survey. In the Y2 post-MDA survey, S. haematobim prevalence and average intensity dropped to 7.6% (95%CI 3.7-15.6) and 6 eggs/10ml urine (95%CI 3-13), respectively. This means a 27.5% (95%CI *-65.2, p=0.39) reduction in prevalence and 24.1% (95%CI *-63.9) reduction in intensity of infection. Both reductions were statistically not significant. School level prevalence in the Y2 post-MDA survey ranged from 0-22.2%. # Conclusions\n\nOverall, STH prevalence and intensity of infection in the Y2 pre-MDA survey was lower than in the Y1 baseline survey. Moreover, the Y2 MDA delivery achieved a significant reduction in prevalence and intensity for each of the three STH species. Counties with not significant reductions had low pre-MDA prevalence and intensities. S. mansoni infection prevalence and intensity decreased significantly after Y2 MDA. The observed re-occurrence of STH infections to higher than baseline values in 6 schools might be related to the sampling or diagnostic error. However, it should be monitored if the same schools continue to have high re-infection rates in Y3 to potentially adapt the treatment strategy. Similarly, the trend in Kwale County, where STH infection intensity increased since Y1 baseline, should be monitored.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vN03p9VpSxTneBuh6eUkX8lOGKXHWMdymxmYtj3fBPY="},"4f25e7e5-b1b0-44b1-a6e7-e780d2326d76":{"id_":"4f25e7e5-b1b0-44b1-a6e7-e780d2326d76","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf"},"hash":"p8jYgVzkOuqhzXyZrfj12LvCll64yObzKmccAGnJf04="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1c0748dc-6f77-4a66-8f1e-45e39846e649","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf"},"hash":"vN03p9VpSxTneBuh6eUkX8lOGKXHWMdymxmYtj3fBPY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b893ee55-6342-4302-b50b-af465c3dde50","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y2 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2014.pdf"},"hash":"Fr7PC2v/irdjETINt7O5CeWcOaZ2XD4wQXQ5EAkhP8c="}},"text":"Treatment data should be obtained for the 5 schools with increased infection prevalence or intensity after Y2 MDA delivery to investigate if treatment was delivered as planned. # Methods of analysis\n\nInfection prevalence and average intensity of infection was calculated for any STH and for each species overall and for each County. 95% confidence intervals (CI) of prevalence were calculated using binomial regression taking into account clustering by school. CIs of average intensity of infection were obtained by negative binomial regression adjusting for school clusters. Relative reductions in prevalence and average intensity of infections (provided as % of baseline prevalence or average intensity) were estimated by binomial regression and negative binomial regression, respectively, taking into account school clusters. P-values were obtained by Wald-test. Moderate intensity infections were classified according to WHO guidelines as 2000-3999 epg for hookworm, 5000-49000 epg for A. lumbricoides, and 1000-9999 epg for T. trichiuris. Heavy intensity infections were classified as >=4000 epg, >=50000 epg, and >=10000 epg, respectively. ---\n# Appendix\n\n# Table 9 Y1 baseline prevalence % (95%CI) by County\n\n|County|STH

based deworming programme was first launched in 2009 targeting more than 8 million school age children out of whom 3.6 million school children were treated for STH in 45 endemic sub-counties. However, this programme faced logistical changes and was re-launched in the year 2012 with Ministries of Health and Education planning to deworm all school age children who live in 66 sub-counties identified as having high prevalence of STH and schistosome infections in Western, Nyanza, Rift-Valley and Coast regions. The impact of the school based deworming programme is monitored in a five year (2012-2017) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programme consisting of pre-post intervention and repeated cross-sectional surveys.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ew/B6oK9bkdA6WRRydw2yPoKcyHaQvx76/rtNQaOkkw="},"a19c0653-ce07-483c-8bb0-4f9b7c2df29d":{"id_":"a19c0653-ce07-483c-8bb0-4f9b7c2df29d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"v9WVC4fN63zZ86jASeHxqnUEMHiphky78oQ+ix/e9Uk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"34db86d0-8e9f-4a20-a146-68fb3ca0474a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"Ew/B6oK9bkdA6WRRydw2yPoKcyHaQvx76/rtNQaOkkw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f76453cf-eecb-4b87-a3ba-948a4106c2c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"NS6l6xxS/bLS78oY7/s8UXpKJ0mBOd/ZjLqX8py219c="}},"text":"The specific objectives of the evaluation are to understand what the long-term impact is on STH and schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity as well as annual programme effectiveness in terms of reductions in prevalence and intensity and monitor re-infection across years. Here we present the report for the year 3 result of the M&E programme. The survey consisted of 200 schools surveyed for mid-term assessment and 60 schools surveyed after the third MDA delivery. However, in the Coast region, year 2 treatment was delivered only 1 month before the year 3 surveys, therefore 27 schools were excluded from the analysis to prevent an overestimation of treatment impact. Moreover, 1 school was replaced since the baseline survey in Bungoma County and was therefore excluded together with the replacement school to allow for comparability between baseline and year 3 mid-term surveys. High treatment coverage has been achieved in all the 16 counties the M&E programme is working on with a total of 5,056,530 (coverage of 78.6%); 5,066,396 (coverage of 76.0%) and 5,270,916 (coverage of 82.2%) children; both enrolled and non-enrolled, being dewormed for STH in years 1, 2 & 3 respectively. For schistosomiasis, a total of 132,767 (coverage of 96.7%); 447,403 (coverage of 83.4%) and 39,446 (coverage of 84.9%) children; both enrolled and non-enrolled, have been dewormed in years 1, 2 & 3 respectively.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+tFCgVeL2Y9/aJbI6WZlK16HtzuuNIBchaDifthUjPA="},"f76453cf-eecb-4b87-a3ba-948a4106c2c6":{"id_":"f76453cf-eecb-4b87-a3ba-948a4106c2c6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"v9WVC4fN63zZ86jASeHxqnUEMHiphky78oQ+ix/e9Uk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a19c0653-ce07-483c-8bb0-4f9b7c2df29d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"+tFCgVeL2Y9/aJbI6WZlK16HtzuuNIBchaDifthUjPA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"87ee1f43-f697-47fc-8754-e7e5c40b2554","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"MtLWE3S21yfkj7SbwylmvZRbMog8jAaZodtGTxucs0A="}},"text":"|Year|STH Pre-MDA Prevalence|STH Post-MDA Prevalence|Reduction (%)|Moderate-Heavy Intensity Pre-MDA|Moderate-Heavy Intensity Post-MDA|Schistosomiasis Pre-MDA Prevalence|Schistosomiasis Post-MDA Prevalence|Reduction (%)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|33.2%|8.8%|73.5%|8.4%|0.9%|26.6%|6.8%|56.0%|\n|2|19.1%|6.0%|68.5%|6.8%|0.6%|15.4%|8.5%| |\n|3|16.4%|6.3%|60.8%|5.6%|0.7%|14.9%| | |\n---\n# Findings\n\nThe prevalence of moderate-heavy infections were; (1.7% - 1.4%), (2.5% - 0.7%) and (2.0% - 0.3%) simultaneously for each pre- and post-MDA in years 1, 2 & 3 respectively. The findings of the M&E programme after three rounds of MDA indicate that STH infections have continued to steadily decline over the three years from initial infection level of 33.6% to 16% for any STH.

This report presents the survey results of 200 schools surveyed for mid-term assessment in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, and Coast regions and 60 schools surveyed after third MDA delivery in the same regions. However, in the Coast region, year two treatment was delivered only 1 month before the Y3 surveys, therefore 27 schools were excluded from the analysis to prevent an overestimation of treatment impact as the time for potential reinfection was much shorter than for the other schools. Moreover, 1 school was replaced since the baseline survey in Bungoma County and was therefore excluded together with the replacement school to allow for comparability between baseline and year 3 mid-term surveys. The full list of these 27 excluded schools is provided in the appendix as table A2. Notably, the 27 schools will be considered for analysis during year 5 (endline) of the study and compared with year 1 (baseline). ---\n# Results\n\nYear 3 mid-term surveys were conducted in 16 counties in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, and Coast regions between 3rd March 2014 and 19th February 2015.

The overall relative reductions from baseline to mid-term assessments are compared to results from other deworming programmes in table 13 and show that our findings are largely similar to what these other national programmes have reported, although it is difficult to detect clear trends.

These variations in reduction are likely caused by geographical heterogeneity and varied initial infection levels in these counties, which could affect reinfection rates. Another study [1], conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis from various studies around the world on efficacy of current drugs against STH infections and reported reductions of 72% for Hookworm, 28% for T. trichiura, and 88% for ascaris. This evaluation was not designed as a drug efficacy evaluation, but it is useful to compare immediate (pre- and post-MDA) reductions which show comparable immediate drops in year 1. The immediate relative reductions for all the three species from year one to three are outlined in table 14 and show that during year one, the reductions were higher except for T. trichiura. The year two reductions slightly decreased compared to year one, further the reductions observed in year three were generally lower than the past two years. As the infection levels reduce over the years, the immediate reductions in infection are expectedly smaller. Immediate infection reductions are likely to be influenced by initial prevalence or intensity of infection, treatment coverage, diagnostic limitations (Kato Katz method used by the M&E programme is less sensitive especially when the prevalence is very low) and the length of time between treatment and post-treatment examination. The immediate reductions for light to heavy intensity of infections for STH combined were higher in year one and two than year three. However, for specific species; A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura immediate reductions have been constant over the three years. Both the overall and immediate relative reductions on moderate to heavy infection intensity for STH are outlined in table 15. After two years of MDA, the programme has successfully reduced heavy and moderate intensity of infection for STH combined by 70.3% and 32.1% respectively. Similar findings were reported in Myanmar, where infections of moderate to heavy intensity reduced from initial prevalence of 18.5% to 7% [2] translating to relative reduction of around 62.2%. However, there the reduction took place after seven years of MDA rather than two. Results for schistosome infections were haphazard and largely not statistically significant, hence not extensively discussed here, especially because interpretation is confounded by the lack of schistosomiasis treatment during year 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MYf1aiWdBBWdkNiQO9NZGK37981byv/xvQMG5G7u1ZA="},"e8b68292-6ed4-4ae4-85be-2baea27b8527":{"id_":"e8b68292-6ed4-4ae4-85be-2baea27b8527","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"v9WVC4fN63zZ86jASeHxqnUEMHiphky78oQ+ix/e9Uk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"565db7f4-2355-4dd8-a1d5-9d7bcd435c93","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"MYf1aiWdBBWdkNiQO9NZGK37981byv/xvQMG5G7u1ZA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2d778684-1697-4a95-8f25-dfe71b9af2b3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"5ObAJDUwdXb2uJ7+nXrlsVIO5zH0ySunAIFEzv6bK98="}},"text":"Places like Kwale County, which showed significant reduction for S. haematobium, can be attributed to effect of seasonal variations or deworming by other programs. Similarly, counties like Homabay, Kisii, Kisumu and Nyamira showed significant reduction for S. mansoni. ---\n# Methods of Analysis\n\nInfection prevalence and average intensity of infections were calculated for STH combined and separately for each specific species using STATA 14. Intensity of infections was defined according to WHO guidelines (WHO, 2011). Confidence intervals for prevalence and average intensity of infections were obtained using binomial and negative binomial regression models, respectively, adjusting for school clustering. Relative reductions in prevalence and average intensity of infections were estimated by binomial regression and negative binomial regression, respectively, taking into account school clusters and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-values obtained using multivariable mixed effects models with random intercepts for schools and counties implemented in R software. Graphs were developed using the ggplot package implemented in R software. Maps were created using ArcGIS Desktop version 10.2.2 software (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA). # Recommendations to the programme\n\nGenerally our results are comparable to what was seen in studies conducted in other countries as shown in Table 13. There is a general fall in infection levels following treatment which begins to climb with time until the next round of treatment is administered according to our observations (figures 3 and 4). The decline is therefore not depicted in a smooth descending line but fluctuates along the years. The most widely implemented method of controlling STH and schistosomiasis infections is through regular administration of anthelminths drugs. However past studies, have shown that this reduces infection intensity and transmission potential but does not achieve eradication [4], [5]. It would, therefore, be important to consider other intervention measures e.g. WASH alongside preventive chemotherapy for the School – Based Deworming Programme and at household levels through communities to accelerate the elimination these infections. Acceleration of the decline in infections may also be achieved by including the adult population and even children below five years in MDAs in certain set ups, something that the current programme does not focus on. A total of 5 counties showed an increase in schistosomiasis infection levels while the rest showed non-significant reductions after two years of MDA.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NBRaxYBD6pDAhjOlWVB1zpy03viDfAjcHrtl+HwfmV0="},"2d778684-1697-4a95-8f25-dfe71b9af2b3":{"id_":"2d778684-1697-4a95-8f25-dfe71b9af2b3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"v9WVC4fN63zZ86jASeHxqnUEMHiphky78oQ+ix/e9Uk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e8b68292-6ed4-4ae4-85be-2baea27b8527","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"NBRaxYBD6pDAhjOlWVB1zpy03viDfAjcHrtl+HwfmV0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"61903181-0fb6-4ec5-ba85-6462e22b077c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y3 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2016.pdf"},"hash":"6m+mQEN4nmRKjFGyFhffYA0P89YWfwgQiStpO5dQakg="}},"text":"---\n# The Kato Katz Method of Diagnosis\n\nThe Kato Katz method of diagnosis used by this programme may not be sensitive enough as a diagnostic tool as infection levels continue to decline as we see in some of the counties.

The specific objectives of the evaluation are to understand what the long-term impact is on Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity, as well as annual programme effectiveness in terms of reductions in prevalence and intensity. Here we present the report for the year 4 results of the M&E programme showing the impact of the school-based deworming programme at the national level. The survey consisted of 60 schools surveyed for pre-MDA assessment and 48 schools surveyed after the fourth mass drug administration (MDA) delivery. However, 12 schools from Homabay, Kisumu and Migori counties were not surveyed during the post-MDA assessment due to last-minute changes in the treatment schedule. This was accounted for and is made clear in the analysis. In the 48 schools, the STH combined pre-MDA prevalence was 18.8% with A. lumbricoides 14.6%, T. trichiura 4.2% and hookworm 2.6%. After treatment, the post-MDA prevalence reduced to; 5.8%, 1.8%, 3.7%, and 1.0% for STH combined, A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm respectively. These translated to an immediate statistically significant reduction in prevalence of 69.1%, 87.6%, 11.9% and 60.8% for STH combined, A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and hookworm respectively. Similarly, based on 48 schools, the year 4 pre-MDA prevalence of schistosome infections were; 1.8% and 3.0% for S. mansoni and S. haematobium respectively and after treatment the prevalence were; 1.2% and 5.3% respectively for S.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"34GNeo/Yx7GxrWiqweMg3HevERB5BQUgWFVopEAuvQE="},"64bec036-e404-4e6c-8795-87a275b56dc8":{"id_":"64bec036-e404-4e6c-8795-87a275b56dc8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"z7juvqHTkN0irg6N3fWrPrwMKwDZ0xZRgN9rxvdzpG4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9c7922fa-8169-4138-a510-1f5126f77732","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"34GNeo/Yx7GxrWiqweMg3HevERB5BQUgWFVopEAuvQE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f218992c-e99b-4cde-8f31-8b962d544847","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"j0akfAHmBIftxvYRSOKabNvcJuKO2BPDsgjigKZQXyg="}},"text":"mansoni and S. haematobium.

While the evaluation was not powered to detect county-level changes, looking at county level results shows heterogeneity in programmatic impact, which is consistent with other research that is finding hot spots that may merit much more intensive programmatic interventions to get to the goal of morbidity control and transmission break. It is also obvious that, of the STHs, children are getting re-infected with A. lumbricoides very rapidly, eroding the gains made by immediate reductions due to drug administration. This has implication of adding additional, more intense interventions. Additionally, as shown below, not covering other age groups and non-enrolled children is likely to be leaving reservoirs of infection in those groups. The evaluation was not designed to look at levels of infection in those groups, but there are indications in the data that younger children tend to have higher moderate-to-heavy infections. The programmatic implication is to increase coverage, the implication for evaluation is to start looking at infection levels in groups beyond school-attending children – these recommendations will be discussed as the programme plans for new stage of implementation. ---\n# Current Page\n\nFinally, we note that drug therapy alone to school age children is only a short term measure of reducing worm infection and reinfection. In fact, several mathematical models suggest that long-term control measures lie in concomitantly improving the quality of the water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and hygiene education in schools, alongside treatment of the neglected groups of the population i.e. the pre-school aged children and the adult populations. Post year five, the program should be scaled to more explicitly target and cover the non-enrolled children, the adult population, and the under-fives since they seem to act as reservoir for infection, if the infection transmission interruption is to be realized. We additionally recommend studies to be conducted after year five of the programme to accurately measure drug efficacy and detect potential emergence of drug resistance to albendazole and praziquantel. # Sampling considerations and changes since inception report\n\nWe note that this study was designed based on the old administrative units (provinces/regions), the sample size was not therefore statistically powered to carry out estimation at the county level (new administration units). However, this study rides on the advantage that these new administrative units were formed by combining several districts together.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"j0akfAHmBIftxvYRSOKabNvcJuKO2BPDsgjigKZQXyg="},"4bcef678-ba92-462c-b522-0eff92cdf8f2":{"id_":"4bcef678-ba92-462c-b522-0eff92cdf8f2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"z7juvqHTkN0irg6N3fWrPrwMKwDZ0xZRgN9rxvdzpG4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f218992c-e99b-4cde-8f31-8b962d544847","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"j0akfAHmBIftxvYRSOKabNvcJuKO2BPDsgjigKZQXyg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6a268103-5554-4db8-a38b-1884591ee5ca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"14FgCcWyVvwncvrh7jOfrE/bgjpvn5v7pRKl3IMJVPE="}},"text":"Nonetheless, we have still summarized our results by these defunct regions. # Introduction\n\nFrom the year 2012, the ministries of health and of education of Kenya started to deworm all school – age children who live in 66 districts (now sub counties) identified as having a high prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosome infections to warrant mass drug administration as per the WHO guidelines in four regions (Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Coast). The impact of the Kenya’s school-based deworming is monitored in a five year (2012-2017) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programme including pre-post intervention and repeated cross-sectional surveys as outlined in figure 1. The repeat cross-sectional surveys are conducted in a representative, stratified, two-stage sample of schools across Kenya. Sub counties stratification was based on both geography and anticipated infection prevalence. The programme contains three tiers of monitoring: i) a national baseline survey including 200 schools in 20 sub counties which aims to establish an accurate\n---\n# National Measurement of Infection Levels\n\n# Surveys Conducted Pre and Post Intervention\n\nSurveys conducted pre and post intervention (pre-post surveys), which monitor 60 of the 200 schools before and immediately after the deworming activity to evaluate reductions in infections that can be directly attributed to programme implementation. Both the year four pre- and post-MDA surveys were done in two sets, all approximately one month before the year 4 treatment dates. At the 1st treatment date (25th February, 2016), 27 schools were surveyed between 6th – 28th January, 2016 for pre-MDA and between 2nd – 20th March, 2016 for post-MDA. While during the 2nd treatment date (26th May, 2016), 33 schools were surveyed between 9th – 25th May, 2016 for pre-MDA and between 4th – 21st July, 2016 for post-MDA. This report therefore presents the survey results of 60 schools surveyed from 16 counties for year 4 pre-MDA assessment in Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, and Coast regions and 48 schools surveyed from 13 counties after fourth MDA delivery in the same regions, with comparison to previous surveys since baseline.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Y2UN6Vhns34crJWQ9AA39i0WkmUMFqzOe05oR8Zm+r0="},"6a268103-5554-4db8-a38b-1884591ee5ca":{"id_":"6a268103-5554-4db8-a38b-1884591ee5ca","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"z7juvqHTkN0irg6N3fWrPrwMKwDZ0xZRgN9rxvdzpG4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4bcef678-ba92-462c-b522-0eff92cdf8f2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"Y2UN6Vhns34crJWQ9AA39i0WkmUMFqzOe05oR8Zm+r0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d9b10b1b-7aa8-4649-bcc3-4f7ea1e7b1ad","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y4 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2017.pdf"},"hash":"cvuPn3EAQuWAu71fNwKwfSi6GZB2ZJpVtlRTOdwGyfE="}},"text":"However, 12 schools from Homabay, Kisumu and Migori counties were not surveyed during the post-MDA assessment due to mixed up in the treatment schedule. # Results\n\nOverall 11,310 children with mean age of 9.6 years (2 – 24 years) were surveyed in both pre- and post-MDA surveys as shown in table 1.

Notably, the prevalence and mean intensity of combined and species specific infections have decreased significantly from baseline to year four post-MDA despite reinfections still occurring between treatments. At the initial level (baseline results), the STH prevalence were 33.6%, 15.2%, 20.7% and 6.3% for STH combined, hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura respectively, these however, dropped to 5.9%, 1.1%, 1.9% and 3.8% respectively after four rounds of MDA, showing an impressive significant relative reduction for any STH infection specific species. The results are a pointer to the efficacy of the single-dose oral albendazole given to the school children once every year. During the year four surveys, the immediate relative reductions in prevalence of STH from pre- to post-MDA were; 69.1%, 60.8%, 87.6% and 11.9% for any STH and specific species of hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections respectively.

The predominance of other species over T. trichiura may indicate that the single-dose albendazole schedule currently used for deworming is less effective for reducing trichuriasis since this parasite is less susceptible to this drug [1], [2].

This decline shows that the program has managed to reduce the morbidity associated with both hookworm and A. lumbricoides infections among the school children for some months during the year. Unfortunately, that gain has been almost erased for A. lumbricoides due to rapid reinfection. During the four years, the program has recorded reinfections for any STH and for specific species after each treatment round. These reinfections have been high in A. lumbricoides. A systematic review and meta-analysis on STH reinfection after mass treatment by Jia T. et al. [3], reported similar findings on reinfections among 42 studies on STH around the world. They concluded that reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Hence, there is a need for frequent anthelmintic drug administration to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Additionally, integrated control approaches emphasizing health education, and WASH are needed to interrupt transmission of STH infections.

The variations in counties are likely due to specific epidemiological situation, geographical heterogeneity, initial prevalence levels/worm burden, different transmission intensities, as well as differing drug uptake and compliance in each county, these further affects the reinfection rates.

However, after the fourth MDA delivery, prevalence of any of the schistosome infections increased in Kakamega, Kilifi, Kwale and Vihiga counties. This increase in infection in four counties should be a cause for concern in the wake of inconsistence treatment schedule witnessed throughout the program period. This is also consistent with data seen in other countries, where ‘hot spots’ or areas of persistent reinfection despite intensive treatment have been found. Even though it might not be feasible to implement a different preventive chemotherapy regimen before end of year five of the program, it is vital to be vigilant of the different patterns of transmission of individual STH and schistosome species [5]. Post year five, it would be useful to conduct studies to accurately measure drug efficacy and detect potential emergence of drug resistance to albendazole and praziquantel [6]–[8]. # Prevalence of Infections\n\nWe established that parasite infections for any STH and any schistosome were more prevalent in younger (ECD) children than older children (table 17), underscoring the inadequate deworming delivered to this group of school children, this might also point to the higher levels of infection among the non-enrolled children.

In fact, several studies suggest that in all but low transmission settings, the treatment of school-aged children alone is unlikely to drive transmission to a level where the parasites cannot persist [10]. Long-term control measures lie in concomitantly improving the quality of the water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and hygiene education in schools. ---\n# References\n\n1. J. Keiser and J.

findings of the year 6 survey which was an extension of the first five years (2012-2017) impact monitoring of the Kenya National School-Based Deworming Programme (KNSBDP). The survey was conducted in 20 counties of Bomet, Kericho, Narok, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Vihiga, Kisumu, Homabay, Kisii, Nyamira, Migori, Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Kitui, Makueni, Wajir and Garissa covering six regions in Kenya. The survey was funded by Evidence Action a non-governmental organization committed to alleviate poverty through evidence based research. The survey revealed that Wajir and Garissa counties have zero prevalence of both STH and schistosome infections. In overall, the MDA programme has driven both STH and schistosome infections prevalence to relatively low levels however not to a point where they are no longer a public health problem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XKs3DCe2y4Ox+bwfxCh1WKb1sQjMCZ2+ahDCcwtrsqI="},"5ad72499-7517-4a0a-93ca-141782c11646":{"id_":"5ad72499-7517-4a0a-93ca-141782c11646","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"hash":"PWHJw4usejKk5slYGuttEIdEcBnYDhTd7hjUiHCA+TA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f1154ec4-dd2b-4d3d-9d1d-d78a551e0ba8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"hash":"XKs3DCe2y4Ox+bwfxCh1WKb1sQjMCZ2+ahDCcwtrsqI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"51e13771-9c7a-4be4-8990-4c25d55da521","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"hash":"d/Lp0l/7f69/UhRmGAylyMqp08D2h1X1LZ0mF+6vftg="}},"text":"The analysis of individual, household and school level factors associated with either STH or schistosome infections revealed that soil eating behaviour, not wearing shoes, household occupancy of more than five members and living in households with earthen floors were significant predisposing factors to these infections especially for any STH infection. Additionally, ECD children showed higher odds of any of the infections. From the findings the programme should conduct a breaking transmission assessment in the northern counties of Kenya with the aim to declaring them free from helminthic infections. Since counties have showed heterogeneity in infection levels, different treatment frequency based on the WHO guidelines should be adopted for the counties. To sustain the chemotherapeutic gains of MDA, incorporation of integrated control approaches emphasizing on health education and WASH interventions to the communities and schools should be adopted. # Introduction\n\nFrom the year 2012, the ministries of health and of education in Kenya started to deworm all school –age children who live in 66 districts (now sub counties) identified as having a high prevalence for STH and schistosome infections to warrant mass drug administration (MDA). The impact of the Kenya’s school-based deworming programme was monitored for five years (2012-2017) with the support from Childrens’ Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), a charitable organization based in the United Kingdom (UK). At the end of the five-year period, new additional funding for year 6 surveys was provided by the Evidence Action with the specific objectives of monitoring and evaluating parasitological outcomes in sites that had routine parasitological monitoring for five years and those sites that have not had routine parasitological monitoring since baseline. This report therefore presents the year 6 survey results from 100 schools in 20 counties. The year 6 results were also compared to previous surveys since baseline. Additionally, the study provided the risk factors associated with STH and schistosome infections. ---\n# Methods\n\nThe year 6 survey utilized cross-sectional design in a representative, stratified, two-stage sample of school children across regions in Kenya. A sample size of 100 schools (5 schools per county) with approximately 108 children per school was determined to be adequate to detect a 5% change in prevalence and intensity of infection, assuming power of 80% and test size of 5%, and considering the anticipated variance in prevalence. The schools were selected based on their year 5 infection endemicity prior to the study.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MZmiPFGLgTTiN4UYJB5ML1NQcolqz+XFEtKoh6aT8jE="},"51e13771-9c7a-4be4-8990-4c25d55da521":{"id_":"51e13771-9c7a-4be4-8990-4c25d55da521","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"hash":"PWHJw4usejKk5slYGuttEIdEcBnYDhTd7hjUiHCA+TA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5ad72499-7517-4a0a-93ca-141782c11646","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"hash":"MZmiPFGLgTTiN4UYJB5ML1NQcolqz+XFEtKoh6aT8jE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"313d7877-1cac-4ed6-a63c-4ad7e6693845","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y6 KEMRI Impact Analysis Report_2018.pdf"},"hash":"pM0lM12rBMkH4Sa/d8oDpaZjWlSapXoE2HQtKkK0z+c="}},"text":"The schools were selected based on their year 5 infection endemicity prior to the study. In each school, 18 children (9 girls and 9 boys) were sampled randomly from each of the six classes; one early childhood development (ECD) class and classes 2 – 6 using random number tables, for a total of approximately 108 children per school. # Data collection\n\nThe year 6 data was collected in two phases between 29th January to 17th February, 2018 and 8th to 24th May, 2018 approximately 12 months prior to the year 6 MDA across 20 counties in across Western, Nyanza, Rift Valley, Eastern and North Eastern regions. Both survey questionnaires and laboratory reporting form were programmed onto android-based smart phones and used to capture data electronically into the Open Data Kit (ODK) system that incorporated in-built data quality checks to prevent data entry errors. # Statistical analysis\n\nInfection prevalence and average intensity of infections were calculated for STH and schistosome infections and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) determined using binomial and negative binomial regression models respectively, taking into account clustering by schools. Infection intensities were classified into light, moderate and heavy infections according to WHO guidelines (Supplementary: Table S1) and the prevalence of light to heavy infections together with 95%CIs obtained using binomial regression model taking into account clustering by schools. Overall, cross-county analysis of the factors associated with STH or schistosome infections was analyzed, first using univariable analysis and described as odds ratio (OR) using mixed effects logistic regression model at two levels; pupils nested within schools selected within counties. To select minimum adequate variables for multivariable analysis, an inclusion criteria of p-value < 0.1 was pre-specified in a forward step-wise variable selection method which selected covariates meeting the set criterion. Adjusted OR (aOR) were obtained by mutually adjusting all minimum generated variables using multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model at 95%CI taking into account hierarchical nature of the data.

Not wearing shoes was associated with higher odds of all the three STH infections and significantly associated with higher A. lumbricoides infection (aOR = 1.51, p = 0.002). High household membership (i.e. more than 5 members per household) was associated with associated higher odds of any STH infections and specifically was significant for A. lumbricoides (aOR = 1.30, p = 0.003).

Additionally, children who reported not taking anthelminthic drugs during the last MDA were associated with higher odds of all the three STH infections, however, this was not significant. School level factors like availability of handwashing facility equipped with soap and water, availability of tissue/newspaper/water for anal cleansing, and always use of school latrine/toilet for defecation were associated with lower odds of all the three STH infections, though these were not significant. # Multivariable analysis of factors associated with schistosome infections\n\nTable 9 gives the multivariable associations between individual, household or school WASH conditions with S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections.

Children who reported not wearing shoes as well as those who did not receive treatment during the last MDA were associated with higher odds of the infections. # Conclusion\n\nThe results showed low levels of both STH and schistosome infections after five years of treatment.

There was observed heterogeneity in infection levels within counties and following WHO recommendation on treatment frequency after five years of MDA; Garissa, Wajir, Kitui, Makueni and Taita Taveta counties would not require MDA, while Bungoma, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kwale, Migori and Mombasa would require MDA once after every two years, and the remaining nine counties would require MDA once every year. Our assessment of the individual, household and school WASH practices and behaviour on STH and schistosome infections suggested mixed impacts. WASH risk factors differed across individual worm species; this is expected given the different mechanisms of infections. The results revealed no clear trend of the relative importance of school or household-level WASH factors, however factors like soil eating, not wearing shoes, high number of household occupants, and living in households with earthen floors increased the odds of STH and schistosome infections. # Recommendations\n\nBased on the survey findings, we recommend the following:\n\n1. The programme should conduct a breaking transmission assessment in the northern counties of Kenya with the aim to declaring them free from helminthic infections. 2. The programme should adopt at county-level different treatment frequency based on the WHO guidelines. 3. To sustain the chemotherapeutic gains of MDA, incorporation of integrated control approaches emphasizing on health education and WASH interventions to the communities and schools should be adopted. # References\n\n1.

risk of parasitic worm infection. In 2012, Kenya re-launched and expanded the National School-Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP) with a goal to eliminate parasitic worms as a public health problem for children in Kenya, providing preventive chemotherapy (PC) to school-age children (SAC) and preschool-age children (PSAC) for both diseases in selected counties across the country. After ten years of the NSBDP’s operations it is important to establish the impact of treatment, assess prevalence and intensity changes, and have a more granular understanding of helminth prevalence across Kenya. The survey results may inform treatment strategy changes including; if and where treatment may be suspended and surveillance systems implemented as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as where to target reservoirs of continued disease transmission using scarce resources to expedite program impact. To this end, Y9 impact assessment was conducted to determine the probability that the overall NSBDP geographic area, counties, and sub-counties (and in the case of SCH, wards) lie within programmatically relevant disease prevalence thresholds for both STH and SCH. Differing from previous surveys, the Y9 survey design made use of large amounts of pre-existing survey, environmental, coverage and spatial data to optimize survey design and analysis. Results from the survey suggest that across all at-risk counties, the overall prevalence for any STH infection sits between 2% to <10% with a >0.999 probability. Species specific thresholds sit at 2% to <10% for A. lumbricoides, 0% to <2% for hookworm, and 0% to <2% for T. trichiuria all with a >0.999 probability. County-specific thresholds for any STH showed more variation. Of the 27 NSBDP counties, 10 are assumed to sit within 0% to <2% prevalence (>0.999 probability with the exception of Wajir which had probability of 0.971), 10 within 2% to <10% (>0.999 probability), and 7 assumed to sit between 10% to <20% (>0.999 probability).

Of the 27 NSBDP counties, four counties were assumed to be between 0% to <1% (>0.999 probability with the exception of Kitui at 0.998 and Taita Taveta at 0.711), 20 counties between 1% to <10% (>0.999 probability with the exception of Kericho at 0.878), two counties at 10% to <20% (>0.999 probability), and Migori County at 20% to <50% (0.953 probability).

Due to the varying levels of STH and SCH infections in each county and the over ten years of national annual treatment delivery strategy, the programme should adopt county-level treatment frequencies based on the WHO prevalence categorization. Where appropriate, treatment frequency decisions should be further decentralized to sub-county level. In the case of SCH, ward level data may also be used. 2.

These recommendations can be refined further by taking a sub-county approach to treatment frequency. 2. Given the demonstrable feasibility, improved precision, and improved cost–effectiveness of MBG approach, it is recommended that going forward, infection prevalence categorization be determined using this modeling approach which accounts for both the explanatory variables and the unobserved stochastic processes around survey location. 3. To avoid potential resurgence of disease, a cost-effective surveillance system should be put into place capable of detecting rising levels of prevalence in counties which have suspended treatment. 4. To sustain the chemotherapeutic gains especially in counties that have been shown not to require regular treatment, innovative, integrated, and cost-effective water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health education approaches should be explored. 5. Based on the prevalence of the moderate-to-heavy intensity of STH, various counties have achieved elimination of STH infections as a public health problem. However, some counties have not achieved this goal. # Introduction\n\n# Global worm burden and interventions\n\nSoil-transmitted helminth (STH) and schistosome infections comprise the two most wide-spread neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) globally. STH infections affect more than 1.5 billion people of the world’s poorest population (800 million of whom are children in the ages 1 to 14 years). Over 200 million people living in Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean are infected with schistosomiasis (SCH) causative parasites. While the global distribution of infection has changed, the majority of the disease burden is now concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, this is likely due to the effective control and economic development in other regions, the absolute number of people infected or at risk may not be decreasing due to population growth. School-age children are particularly vulnerable to chronic infection that can impair mental and physical development and reduce school attendance and educational achievement. Both STH and schistosomiasis have been recognized as having significant developmental and educational effects on children which can. # Footnotes\n\n1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BwMh9ZSp1UNaAj5PZzBc7Ef07QQ/Uin+n/m0Cc2aiQM="},"e8010715-4fbd-455b-97da-1ff4f34166e3":{"id_":"e8010715-4fbd-455b-97da-1ff4f34166e3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"cntZGlU6tTnq6SS6+zwG/fYkFiQukPiXvWrMTThn/Qk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e96aa294-18f8-417a-b52d-707cdc80badd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"BwMh9ZSp1UNaAj5PZzBc7Ef07QQ/Uin+n/m0Cc2aiQM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f6250b53-ead5-4c9b-ac0f-6e7ba34d5ed3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"EBL/IiGec3AAtbTk2T7KaWOGnrHTPQs08iymo8Poo+k="}},"text":"# Footnotes\n\n1.

Infection with both STHs and schistosomes can lead to local and systemic pathological effects including anemia, growth stunting, impaired cognition, decreased physical fitness, and organ-specific effects, while severe cases can lead to intestinal obstructions and gangrene [6-8]. Repeated preventative chemotherapy (PC) with albendazole or mebendazole for STH, and with praziquantel for schistosomiasis, is used to control helminth morbidity within at-risk populations. All three drugs are well suited to PC given their known safety profile, tolerability and low cost, and are often administered through school-based deworming campaigns [7]. Using schools as a platform for PC allows a captive population for treatment, maintaining high coverage levels while minimizing cost and targeting those at most risk. Regular school-based deworming is a proven, cost-effective strategy that can avert the health and educational consequences of STH infections [8-11]. # Kenya Worm Burden and the National School-Based Deworming Programme\n\nKenya is endemic with both STH and schistosomiasis, with over 6 million children at risk of parasitic worm infection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RQ4er6B7nJE37F5/tvag+uAtwXPpwH7YUM/Z/lXrjHw="},"f6250b53-ead5-4c9b-ac0f-6e7ba34d5ed3":{"id_":"f6250b53-ead5-4c9b-ac0f-6e7ba34d5ed3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"cntZGlU6tTnq6SS6+zwG/fYkFiQukPiXvWrMTThn/Qk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e8010715-4fbd-455b-97da-1ff4f34166e3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"RQ4er6B7nJE37F5/tvag+uAtwXPpwH7YUM/Z/lXrjHw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"183ef816-7f34-4d56-be7f-3401a53a6751","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"whqO/9hhEpQZD6eQcMrE4WpKq03Mh4Ff8uBsxmDWWY0="}},"text":"In 2012, Kenya re-launched and expanded the National School-Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP) with a goal to eliminate parasitic worms as a public health problem8 (EPHP) in Kenya, by providing PC to all school-age children (SAC) and preschool-age children (PSAC) for both diseases in selected counties across the country. The NSBDP is a Kenya Vision 2030 flagship program and is aligned with the disease-specific targets within the World Health Organization (WHO’s) road map for NTDs 2021 - 2030. The programme has annually targeted to deworm over 6 million children across 27 STH endemic counties in parts of Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Central, Eastern, North Eastern and Coast regions. The NSBDP aims to treat over 80% of all preschool and school-age children aged between 2 to 14 years for STH, whether enrolled or unenrolled in school, within all endemic areas necessitating treatment based on WHO guidelines as determined at the beginning of the program. Additionally, NSBDP treats a subset of counties that are co-endemic for schistosomiasis, targeting school-age children only, aged 5 to 14 years. The NSBDP is currently implemented by the Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) within the Ministry of Health and the School Health, Nutrition and Meals (SHNM) Unit within the Ministry of Education. The program has received independent impact monitoring via the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) since its initiation. Prevalence surveys have been performed in Kenya from 2012 to 2020, with evaluation points being Y1 (2012), Y3 (2016), Y5 (2017) and Y6 (2018).

Differing from previous surveys, the Y9 survey design made use of the large amounts of survey, environmental, coverage and spatial data to geo-statistically optimize survey design and analysis for both STH and SCH infections. The overall goal of the survey was to determine the probability that the overall NSBDP geographic area, counties, and sub-counties (and in the case of SCH, wards) lie within programmatically relevant disease prevalence thresholds for both STH and SCH.

Given the need for a SAC population estimates, surveys represent a substantial proportion of helminth control program budgets. As mass treatments of STH and schistosome infections have been sustained for a number of years, there is a global push to measure impact of investment and prevalence reductions across numerous geographies and therefore a need to cost-optimize components of these surveys to make best use of available resources. Recent innovations in survey design using geospatial statistical methods, such as model-based geostatistics (MBG), to select survey sites have been shown to deliver more precise results, given the same resources, than traditional design approaches. Critically for the cost-effectiveness of helminth control programs, MBG differs from traditional survey design in the selection of sites for surveying and the information which is derived from those sites post-survey. Traditional design suggests randomization of sites for surveying across representative areas, such as ecological zones. MBG uses predictive models to identify sites which provide the most predictive power for post-survey modeling of prevalence. In this way, purposive sampling can be used to target the most informative sites and maximize survey precision under given resource constraints. In addition, traditional methods for post-survey estimation of prevalence do not consider prior prevalence, most risk factors, or geospatial variation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"whqO/9hhEpQZD6eQcMrE4WpKq03Mh4Ff8uBsxmDWWY0="},"2532e2f5-d58a-486e-8ef2-ce6a94f63658":{"id_":"2532e2f5-d58a-486e-8ef2-ce6a94f63658","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"cntZGlU6tTnq6SS6+zwG/fYkFiQukPiXvWrMTThn/Qk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"183ef816-7f34-4d56-be7f-3401a53a6751","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"whqO/9hhEpQZD6eQcMrE4WpKq03Mh4Ff8uBsxmDWWY0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b54172c8-dab5-4c39-a486-bb5a65abe4c2","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"fnxaZYFlJ4tnN3K1AsfdhpmidxDAXuCMAuLTSN8I3fQ="}},"text":"MBG, however, uses this information post-survey to create predictive models of prevalence which are as accurate as possible, under some stated assumptions.

Based on the current results, morbidity due to STH is no longer an issue at population level among SAC. This, however, may not be the case when monitoring infection at specific county level. SCH paints a slightly different picture in that the prevalence has remained low, regardless of the slight increase for both species since the Y6 survey. These increases were however non-significant, suggesting that they may be related only to the; statistical precision of the current diagnostic tools, disruptions in treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and frequent praziquantel supply chain issues. In addition, given the focal nature of SCH, country or county levels of infections may be hiding hot spots of disease at lower geographic levels. Using the MBG approach, treatment requirements for the two diseases can now be confidently refined. For STH, the prior approach has been to target all NSBDP geographic areas for yearly treatment. Currently,\n---\n# Current Findings and Recommendations\n\nAfter nearly ten rounds of annual MDA, a number of counties have a very high probability of sitting below 2% prevalence, or between 2% to 10%. WHO guidelines suggest that at these stages’ treatment can be suspended with continued monitoring for resurgence or treatment be reduced to only once every two years, respectively. These represent significant changes to the way the program has previously been administered and a potentially drastic reduction in resources required. Looking at a more granular level, an even larger proportion of the NSBDP geographic area may be able to shift treatment frequency, with the majority of infection isolated to select areas of Western Kenya. The decision to begin determining treatment frequency at a sub-county level however, should be balanced with political will and the potential logistic burden of a highly variable county wide approach. SCH has a known focality around water bodies given the schistosome life cycle. This can be seen in the focalization of SCH from the current results particularly at the ward level. Through the use of MBG approach, SCH infection across counties can now be differentiated at lower geographic level like sub-county, and use ward level data to optimize treatment frequency, allowing higher prevalence wards which may have previously been hidden by county averages to be identified and targeted. In settings where helminth prevalence has been reduced to very low levels, high frequency PC is decreasingly cost-effective due to the ratio of children needing treatment and those receiving it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pIZaA7WROgKxQI2WzgMwDnzLbMiJJ3c/01gxhVCZplM="},"f77eb233-6a21-4744-9f0c-5b373dd18fbf":{"id_":"f77eb233-6a21-4744-9f0c-5b373dd18fbf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"cntZGlU6tTnq6SS6+zwG/fYkFiQukPiXvWrMTThn/Qk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a9d06b09-809f-4f3c-b44c-0c7cc687a99b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"pIZaA7WROgKxQI2WzgMwDnzLbMiJJ3c/01gxhVCZplM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1d610a56-411d-4839-9670-bc28f0374326","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"A/TdRhJ096ci9Ux9eILz0qnErPxHt4iH5rpX6Wp89Mw="}},"text":"At 2% prevalence, only two out of every 100 children will be infected, yet the entire cohort will be targeted to receive deworming medication. While it is critical that all children with helminths be attended to, subsequent deworming of an entire population becomes less cost-effective relative to other interventions and programs within national health budgets. WHO recommendations suggest reducing treatment frequencies in line with prevalence reductions, including suspension of PC, but with continued monitoring where STH or schistosomiasis prevalence is less than 2%. This is to ensure that resurgence is avoided when treatment suspension is warranted [22]. To maintain the cost-effectiveness of deworming, novel surveying strategies and avenues for maximizing cost-precision as a critical component of long-term deworming strategy should be explored. This is to ensure that deworming remains within health budgets and years of steady progress in elimination of both STH and schistosomiasis as a public health problem not be lost [22]. The MBG method used during this survey has been shown to be feasible and precise, capable of being performed with similar or lower levels of resources compared to traditional site selection and analysis methods. Future impact assessment surveys of the NSBDP will employ the MBG approach. # Recommendations\n\n1. Due to the varying levels of STH and SCH infections in each county and the over ten years of national annual treatment delivery strategy, the programme should adopt county-level treatment frequencies based on the WHO prevalence categorization. Where appropriate, treatment frequency decisions should be further decentralized to sub-county level. In the case of SCH, ward level data may also be used. 2. Based on the county level STH prevalence estimates using the model-based geostatistics (MBG) approach, ten counties may warrant suspending treatment, another ten counties will require PC once every two years, and the remaining seven counties may require PC once every year.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aRRkMVSXQUjzPfxkP5pY3FDEIDD1CSrh6tz/iSN7oqs="},"1d610a56-411d-4839-9670-bc28f0374326":{"id_":"1d610a56-411d-4839-9670-bc28f0374326","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"cntZGlU6tTnq6SS6+zwG/fYkFiQukPiXvWrMTThn/Qk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f77eb233-6a21-4744-9f0c-5b373dd18fbf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"aRRkMVSXQUjzPfxkP5pY3FDEIDD1CSrh6tz/iSN7oqs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6e9a51aa-77d0-4d1d-b2c1-ef1e64ed49ea","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"CVRUPWPfd29VvwhMVZCtXsy93dPu2vVINHbXJCs1hiA="}},"text":"# Counties Requiring Treatment Adjustments\n\n|Suspending Treatment|PC Once Every Two Years|PC Once Every Year|\n|---|---|---|\n|Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Kirinyaga, Wajir|Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, Migori, Homabay, Kisumu, Busia, Trans Nzoia, Tana River, Garissa|Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga, Narok, Kisii, Nyamira, Siaya|\n---\n# Recommendations\n\nThese recommendations can be refined further by taking a sub-county approach to treatment frequency. 1. Based on the county level schistosome prevalence estimates using the MBG approach, two counties 18 may consider treatment suspension, twenty-two counties 19 will require PC once every two years, and three counties 20 will require PC once every year. These recommendations can be refined further by taking a sub-county approach to treatment frequency. 2. Given the demonstrable feasibility, improved precision, and improved cost–effectiveness of MBG approach, it is recommended that going forward, infection prevalence categorization be determined using this modeling approach which accounts for both the explanatory variables and the unobserved stochastic processes around survey location. 3. To avoid potential resurgence of disease, a cost-effective surveillance system should be put into place capable of detecting rising levels of prevalence in counties which have suspended treatment. 4. To sustain the chemotherapeutic gains especially in counties that have been shown not to require regular treatment, innovative, integrated, and cost-effective water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health education approaches should be explored. 5. Based on the prevalence of the moderate-to-heavy intensity of STH, various counties have achieved elimination of STH infections as a public health problem 21 (EPHP). However, some counties have not achieved this goal.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"A/TdRhJ096ci9Ux9eILz0qnErPxHt4iH5rpX6Wp89Mw="},"6e9a51aa-77d0-4d1d-b2c1-ef1e64ed49ea":{"id_":"6e9a51aa-77d0-4d1d-b2c1-ef1e64ed49ea","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"cntZGlU6tTnq6SS6+zwG/fYkFiQukPiXvWrMTThn/Qk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1d610a56-411d-4839-9670-bc28f0374326","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"A/TdRhJ096ci9Ux9eILz0qnErPxHt4iH5rpX6Wp89Mw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"94ae95f4-b624-4cdf-9058-6d9cd78d175e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf","file_name":"DtW_Y9 KEMRI Survey Report_2023.pdf"},"hash":"UaFExgbIbNURIelPOyswhzy8hlbBJdgH8ppNDG2ZWX8="}},"text":"However, some counties have not achieved this goal. 18 Bungoma and Nyamira\n\n19 Narok, Bomet, Kericho, Nandi, Kisii, Kisumu, Siaya, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Taita Taveta, Busia, Kakamega, Vihiga, Trans Nzoia, Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Garissa, Wajir and Kirinyaga\n\n20 Migori, Homabay and Tana River\n\n21 EPHP is classified as a geographic area having reached less than 2% of moderate to heavy intensity for STH infection\n---\n# References\n\n1. de Silva, N.

2024\n\nAs people and organizations grapple with how to best use (and limit) rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, here are a few principles to guide Evidence Action’s adoption of such technologies as we think big and act urgently to reduce the burden of poverty for hundreds of millions. Evidence Action permits staff to experiment with AI tools in their work. In doing so, you are encouraged to iterate, again, with the use of AI while understanding that formal approval is needed to institutionalize an AI tool into a system or process. 1. AI tools have the potential to augment our work by enhancing analysis, content generation, and other only-just-imagined uses. Try them out! 2. Prototype the integration of AI tools into workstreams in consultation with supervisors and IT and with careful attention to results and risks. Approval by the AI Steering Committee (see below) will be required to institutionalize an AI tool into a system or process. # Guidelines for use\n\n1. Humans make decisions and we will remain human-centered in our use of AI. 1. While AI tools might assist us in the analysis of data, creation of content, or performance of tasks, humans–rather than AI tools–will make decisions. 2. We view AI tools as means to amplify and augment human abilities and as another avenue to challenge convention in pursuit of our mission. 2. Everyone is accountable for their work products. 1. If you use AI tools in your work, you are still responsible for the final product and any errors therein. 2. Use due care in evaluating products created with the assistance of AI tools. 3. Be transparent in your use of AI for work. 1. As appropriate, acknowledge when and how you use AI tools in your work. Specific requirements for acknowledgment will be left to supervisors to establish based on the nature of the work, the significance of the contributions of specific AI tools, and our existing policies (more on these below). 2. You are encouraged to share promising applications of (or concerns about) AI tools with your colleagues, for example via the #EvAcGPT Slack channel. 4. As Evidence Action employees, we all have a responsibility to protect Evidence Action’s confidential and proprietary information, including organizational intellectual property. 1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tMM8wLlBu2ds5G2HJdKiZ/XKvmBnk8NmFGliCmd0Z+8="},"4288f2cb-710d-4761-8804-55ace04c2d15":{"id_":"4288f2cb-710d-4761-8804-55ace04c2d15","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"ANqz4dGRWf/pgncXJuSPCOHBvNO7V4tIjSQWVsWRa5Q="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"075322aa-3950-4117-bda5-2fa0c93ed03b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"tMM8wLlBu2ds5G2HJdKiZ/XKvmBnk8NmFGliCmd0Z+8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"06ef9c2a-1104-4473-93b8-27945bfb1a82","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"Tj8frlcIxa1mlARcuRL48zgf2kRPd7a/MhBFy+q4UKo="}},"text":"1. Different AI tools use your inputs differently and might expose information you input and/or use it to generate results for other users. ---\n# Risks of use\n\nBe knowledgeable and informed about the risks and limitations of generative AI tools. While these will continue to evolve, some risks to consider are:\n\n1. Generative AI tools regularly “hallucinate,” providing false but plausible and correct-seeming information. This information can seem persuasive but could be entirely fabricated or inaccurate. 2. AI tools may amplify biases via their output because they are trained on data sets derived from the internet, and their data may include overrepresented, racist, misogynistic, and other biased views. 3. Using generative AI tools might create reputational risks for the organization when it produces work containing inaccurate information or for purposes that people might consider disingenuous or offensive (e.g. to write a “heartfelt message”). 4. There are risks and debates around ethical storytelling and AI. For example, AI-generated but realistic images might be used to evoke sympathy, without representing real images or people. 5. There are risks and debates around intellectual property and how generative AI tools have incorporated the text and work of creators without compensation. # Preliminary Governance of Adoption\n\n1. While the above guidelines and risks are not comprehensive, they are intended to provide practical guidance on our use of AI tools, which will evolve. Some tools, such as proofreading plug-ins (e.g. Grammarly) or fundraising tools are already in regular use and include AI-powered features; these guidelines are not meant to prevent their use. As noted above, consult your supervisor and our IT team for guidance around specific applications of AI tools. We will need to iterate, again together as we seek to responsibly adopt these technologies in furtherance of our mission. 2. These principles supplement and support rather than supplant the existing policies, regulations, and laws we already follow regarding the safeguarding of data, the use of digital tools, and how we communicate and attribute (most directly our Information Management, Confidentiality, IT Acceptable Use, and Communications policies and Privacy Statement). 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Vw1aL2UjQB5nFPoR/5pTD8hiP/E7aU1mggf90Nx1BCk="},"06ef9c2a-1104-4473-93b8-27945bfb1a82":{"id_":"06ef9c2a-1104-4473-93b8-27945bfb1a82","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"ANqz4dGRWf/pgncXJuSPCOHBvNO7V4tIjSQWVsWRa5Q="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4288f2cb-710d-4761-8804-55ace04c2d15","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"Vw1aL2UjQB5nFPoR/5pTD8hiP/E7aU1mggf90Nx1BCk="}},"text":"3.

Purpose\n\nAs a non-profit charity operating internationally, Evidence Action is committed to promoting the rights of the children including the right to be protected from abuse and exploitation. Evidence Action takes active measures to ensure children’s right to protection are fully realized. Evidence Action’s expectation is that its management, employees, partners, sub contractors, consultants and others who work with Evidence Action have children’s best interest at heart. This Global Child Protection Policy is Evidence Action’s statement of intent demonstrating its commitment to safeguarding children from abuse and exploitation and makes clear to everyone in the organization, and all stakeholders who come into contact with Evidence Action, what is required in relation to the protection of children and that child abuse or exploitation in any form is unacceptable to Evidence Action. In all Evidence Action programs and activities, we aim to create 'child safe' environments, both internally and externally, where children are respected, protected, empowered and active in their own protection, and where staff are skilled, confident, competent and well supported in meeting their protection responsibilities. This Global Child Protection Policy has been adopted by Evidence Action as the official policy for Evidence Action applicable to its worldwide activities. Where a country-specific policy has been or will be adopted, it will follow the principles and spirit of this global policy and will be adapted to comply with local laws and practices. # B. Guiding Principles\n\nEvidence Action believes that all children have a right to be safe at all times and we have an obligation to provide child safe and child friendly environments and programs. All children have equal rights to protection from abuse and exploitation regardless of their gender, race, religious or political beliefs, age, physical or mental health, sexual orientation, family and social background and culture, economic status or criminal background. Evidence Action has a duty of care to all children that we work for in all our offices. All children should be protected against discrimination in treatment or otherwise, irrespective of child’s caste, race, socio-economic status, sex, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability or any other factor. ---\n# C.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TlFV9ONvR4z68ls8I+lrqkE9Dvglyv4RtGSxs3bNRXI="},"8cb57b25-b107-4938-8ef0-783a5ef12534":{"id_":"8cb57b25-b107-4938-8ef0-783a5ef12534","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"hash":"cIjdxiylRVJwXWrIez+z+TLpIiGbWp20eD5n6gix9Zw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ea959d8-0942-4499-b054-4686da8881a8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"hash":"TlFV9ONvR4z68ls8I+lrqkE9Dvglyv4RtGSxs3bNRXI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7b9fe4bd-9271-47b8-b487-e9542b966797","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"hash":"Ub/2fKWP0BOgKFWJLldwRNcOZ2JZj4lLFmAM7o1ql0U="}},"text":"---\n# C.

Definitions\n\nA Child: Every human being under the age of eighteen years. Child Protection: The responsibilities, measures and activities that Evidence Action undertakes to safeguard children from both intentional and unintentional abuse or exploitation. Child Abuse: All forms of physical abuse, emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse and exploitation, neglect or negligent treatment, trafficking, commercial or other exploitation of a child and includes any actions that results in actual or potential harm to a child. In addition, Child Abuse may be a deliberate act or it may be failing to act to prevent harm to a child. Child Abuse consists of anything which individuals, institutions or processes do or fail to do, intentionally or unintentionally, which harms a child or damages their prospect of safe and healthy development into adulthood. # E. Responsibilities under this Child Protection Policy\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Evidence Action management to ensure that all Evidence Action participants in their area of responsibility are aware of and agree to abide by this policy. Evidence Action will conduct appropriate risk assessments of its programs, projects and locations to provide a safe and inclusive environment for the children we support and will conduct criminal record and reference checks for staff that come into regular contact with children. Where Evidence Action has implemented a country-specific Child Protection Policy, the country lead is responsible for ensuring all participants are made aware of and follow the applicable country-specific policy.

If a combined business/personal itinerary is greater than the cost of a business-only airfare, only the business portion of the ticket will be reimbursed. In general, Evidence Action does not support a substitution or exchange philosophy with regard to travel expenditures. If a Staff member chooses a less expensive option, it would not be appropriate to utilize this “cost savings” somewhere else.

Such approvals should be made in advance of incurring the expense. This email exchange should then subsequently be attached to the expense report when the expense is submitted. # 4. Long-Term Travel\n\nFor any Long-Term Travel, expenses for lodging and accommodations are allowable at the standard maximum daily rate.

M&IE is intended to substantially cover the cost of meals and incidental travel expenses, but eligibility restrictions do apply. The M&IE rate is made up of Lunch 40%, Dinner 40%, and Incidental Expenses 20%. An exception applies in Kenya, where staff are eligible to claim the M&IE rate plus one receipted meal. Transport and Lodging & Accommodations are separate from M&IE. If breakfast is not included in lodging, breakfast can be claimed at 30% of the M&IE rate, by providing a receipt. On both the first and last day of the business trip, the rate will be based on 100% of the daily M&IE rate. For early morning or late evening travel, staff will be entitled to breakfast at a maximum rate of 30% or dinner at a maximum rate of 45% of the applicable daily M&IE rate. Receipts are required to claim this. For residential full board trainings and conferences, M&IE will be paid at 20% of M&IE rate, which is the incidental expenses portion only. If meals are provided to you during your trip, you may not claim the M&IE rate for the meal provided for that day. This is important in reconciling your travel advance. Travel to the field location outside the assigned district of the Duty Station for one day’s work will have the Staff paid a lunch allowance that will be based on the M&IE rate at 40%.

It is therefore critical that we have established procedures for managing them. # Scope\n\nThis handbook outlines grant procedures for all departments that manage or work on grants. Sections of the handbook are organized chronologically to mimic the grant life cycle. This includes:\n\n1. Applying for a grant\n2. Grant Receipt and On-boarding\n3. Grant Implementation\n4. Grant Renewal or Close-out\n\nEvidence Action’s grant policy and procedures for grant accounting are not covered in this handbook. For details on Evidence Action’s grant policy, please see Global Finance Manual For Staff.

Evidence Action issues grants, and not contracts, with organizations that implement our programs. Examples of contracts may include IT support, a vendor that supplies program materials, or training to support a larger programmatic effort or initiative. (Note: If training is the primary program or intervention, it should be funded as a grant, not a contract. ) A more detailed comparison can be seen in the “Types of Agreement” chart.

Salesforce is used for the following purposes as it relates to grants:\n\n- Tracking organizations, funding opportunities, and current grants. - Recording projected revenue for applications and other opportunities and recording funding that we have received or will receive through a signed grant agreement. - Recording application deadlines, report due dates, and other deadlines associated with a funding organization or specific grant. - Tracking payments owed to Evidence Action, invoices, and funding when it is received. - Logging fund codes, grant restrictions, and links to agreements. - Tracking email conversations with donors and phone calls (see “Cirrus Insight” below). The names and labels within the Salesforce platform may differ from the terms used by Evidence Action. Below are terms you will come across within the Salesforce system and their meanings:\n\n- ➢ Account = Funder/Foundation/Grantor\n- ➢ Contacts = People from funding organization\n- ➢ Opportunities = Potential, Active or Inactive Grants\n\nProgram Leads, Grants, and Fundraising staff should request a Salesforce license from their manager. Information on how to obtain a Salesforce license and training can be found HERE. # Cirrus Insight (for Salesforce users)\n\nAnyone with a Salesforce license can use Cirrus Insight to quickly capture important grant information discussed via emails, calls and other communications between Evidence Action and funders. - You can attach emails (directly from your email - using either web-based Gmail or Outlook) and log calls you’ve had to a contact, grantee organization, or application in SalesForce.

If a potential funder will not accept our full 18% indirect rate, a waiver must be obtained by the Program Lead from the CFAO by emailing grants@evidenceaction.org and receiving a response, before applying for the grant. When creating a budget that does not allow the full 18% indirect rate, the following steps should be considered by the Program Lead:\n\n- Including costs that are typically considered a part of the indirect cost pool, but that can be billed directly to the grant. (e.g. Communications staff time). - Adding a “contingency” line item that includes additional costs that are likely to be incurred because overhead costs are not being fully recovered. - Exploring if the funder will allow the inclusion of a percentage of funds that would be designated as “Reserve Funds”. # (4)\n\nWhen necessary, Program Finance staff translates the budget into the donor template. For accuracy and institutional memory, Program Finance maintains both Evidence Action’s budget template and the donor template in Box to ensure that the same FS categories are mapped to the donor template categories for financial reports.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"u/+FIJVcFtxZG+FZ9yJ2vD6If/0s/bWRoC9kxXVDRCY="},"fc650939-2152-456c-ab3c-5af57e39efdd":{"id_":"fc650939-2152-456c-ab3c-5af57e39efdd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Grants Management Procedures.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"kBUDl8ANujtTlX1W2SLNbr60ZowdQ6SLjp/6CrdSht0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9394fe4a-a47e-420f-9a41-2d2d4b8c577e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"u/+FIJVcFtxZG+FZ9yJ2vD6If/0s/bWRoC9kxXVDRCY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"21bc16d8-3b81-4ffb-81ad-a984080e2ea5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"claTWUbrt9rjNhee6jgtOWmMK4Ljmda2REGe7cZBW1M="}},"text":"# (5)\n\nProgram Lead or Program Finance consults with Grants Budgets, for grant applications implemented in the Africa Region. # (6)\n\nProgram Lead emails the budget to grants@evidenceaction.org for final review preferably at least two days before it is submitted to the donor.

The donor should be notified as soon as possible when the need for a prior approval is necessary.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LXO4ZW8OVAZTtwwRLlE7KrTBIC5CvM46C/3RYIwXIu8="},"a30ebdc9-b659-48d5-962e-e0b7c18f3f2a":{"id_":"a30ebdc9-b659-48d5-962e-e0b7c18f3f2a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Grants Management Procedures.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"kBUDl8ANujtTlX1W2SLNbr60ZowdQ6SLjp/6CrdSht0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8f14a9d1-1956-43ed-ab49-eb1296d38e62","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"LXO4ZW8OVAZTtwwRLlE7KrTBIC5CvM46C/3RYIwXIu8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6ac7409e-b38e-4c2d-81a3-f887fa670b2c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"XFnG/JMPJGiPqQUp8iXX5tByFfz6LZdGFDgeShhpScI="}},"text":"The donor should be notified as soon as possible when the need for a prior approval is necessary. ---\n# SUB-GRANTS\n\nIn some cases, program teams may decide that the most effective way of meeting the deliverables of a grant is to enter into a sub-grant. During the Kick-off call held at the beginning of a grant, Grants Compliance will note on the checklist if sub-grants and sub-contracts are allowable. Typically, at the kick-off call there will also be a conversation as to whether or not there is a plan to enter into sub-contracts or sub-grants and what the process will entail, if allowable. If sub-contracts are allowable the Program Lead should follow the Global Procurement Procedures. Before entering into a sub-grant, the potential sub-recipient undergoes a due diligence process, led by Grants Compliance to ensure that it is eligible to receive funds from a U.S. based non-profit, that its capable of meeting the deliverables, is able to manage the financial requirements, and that it can meet the provisions being passed-through to them from the prime grant. 1. Sanctions List Screening. Sub-recipients, like all entities receiving funds from Evidence Action, must be screened to ensure that they are not on any sanctions list that would prevent them from receiving funds from a U.S. based non-profit. The process of screening entities through the sanctions list can be found HERE. If an entity is on one of the sanctions lists above, the General Counsel will notify the entity that we are unable to enter into an agreement with it, per Evidence Action’s Grants Management policy. 2. Pass-through requirements. Grants Compliance will review the prime award to see if there are requirements that would “flow-through” to a sub-grantee. If so, Grants Compliance will send these requests with the Financial Management Survey (see #3 below). An example of a pass-through requirement is the Global Innovation Fund’s requirement that Evidence Action have all sub-grantees and sub-contractors sign the GIF Code of Conduct. 3. Due Diligence Review. Potential sub-recipients must complete the Financial Management Survey or a more thorough due diligence review based on the scope of work the sub-recipient will be implementing. The Program Lead, Grants Compliance, and Program Finance will lead the coordination of any due diligence work.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2aJDYcgjevUBlsrM3ufhnA9en/OQrddm0sUo7jleVAE="},"6ac7409e-b38e-4c2d-81a3-f887fa670b2c":{"id_":"6ac7409e-b38e-4c2d-81a3-f887fa670b2c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Grants Management Procedures.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"kBUDl8ANujtTlX1W2SLNbr60ZowdQ6SLjp/6CrdSht0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a30ebdc9-b659-48d5-962e-e0b7c18f3f2a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"2aJDYcgjevUBlsrM3ufhnA9en/OQrddm0sUo7jleVAE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"91fa2405-0742-4ebe-a43d-953ede28621c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"yEVK5Dq+xbc5GQchM+ap/7E5WgaY7KEyItBdYseb/Q4="}},"text":"The Program Lead, Grants Compliance, and Program Finance will lead the coordination of any due diligence work.

Drafting and finalizing the agreement\n1. Templates. Agreement templates pre-approved by the General Counsel can be found HERE. Grants Compliance will work with the Program Lead to decide which template is most appropriate. 2. “Pass-through clauses” are the clauses in a prime grant that must be incorporated into a sub-grant or contract. Grants Compliance ensures that all required pass-through clauses are incorporated into the final agreement with the subgrantee or subcontractor. 3. Budgets and Payment Schedules. Budgets and payment schedules should reflect the type of agreement. ---\n# Sub-grants:\n\n- Approved sub-recipient budgets should reflect anticipated costs to implement the program including the organization’s indirect rate. Staff time should be calculated as a percent of each employee’s time. - Evidence Action pays sub-grantees for the actual costs that are incurred by the subgrantee while implementing the grant. The costs must be in the approved budget, reasonable, and supported by documentation (if requested. )\n- Generally, for a medium or low risk sub-grantee, a payment schedule should be designed so that the grantee has funds in advance of incurring the expense. A cost-reimbursement structure may be more appropriate for a high-risk grantee. - At least 10% of the grant should be scheduled to be paid after the final deliverable is submitted, reviewed, and accepted. # (5) Monitoring. When financial and narrative reports are submitted they are reviewed by Program Finance and Program Lead respectively. Invoices are paid according to the organization’s and individual programs’ AP procedures. Special attention should be given to ensure that all expenses are allowable and within the approved budget. Grants Compliance and Program Lead are responsible for overseeing on-going due diligence as determined during the due diligence review.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XFnG/JMPJGiPqQUp8iXX5tByFfz6LZdGFDgeShhpScI="},"91fa2405-0742-4ebe-a43d-953ede28621c":{"id_":"91fa2405-0742-4ebe-a43d-953ede28621c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Grants Management Procedures.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"kBUDl8ANujtTlX1W2SLNbr60ZowdQ6SLjp/6CrdSht0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6ac7409e-b38e-4c2d-81a3-f887fa670b2c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"XFnG/JMPJGiPqQUp8iXX5tByFfz6LZdGFDgeShhpScI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"83e052d8-bca8-40a1-a875-2e6cf96dd3b3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"dPmXenksSt9QJtfXpfirS2eAAZ9zXM8AZ7yZHGdYJoA="}},"text":"---\n# GRANT AMENDMENTS AND RENEWAL\n\n# Amendments\n\n# Initiated by Evidence Action\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Program Lead to implement the program in alignment with active grants, but also to ensure that if there are changes to the program that are not in alignment, that we notify the donor as soon as possible. The types of changes that may require both approval from a funder and, if approved, will likely require a modification, include:\n\n- Changes to the scope of work, timeline, or deliverables. - A change to the Period of Performance/Term/end date of the grant. - Slow spending that will result in the need for a change to the budget or end date of the grant. - Change to any clause that the funder may deem necessary such as address or key personnel. When the Program Lead identifies the need for an amendment they email the GLT Program Lead, Program Finance, and Grants Compliance. If necessary, Grants Compliance schedules an internal call to discuss the request. Grants Compliance emails the donor with the request and, if appropriate, sets-up a call to discuss with the donor and Program Lead (and Program Finance if the changes are related to the budget. ) The GLT Program Lead is copied on all emails and, depending on the relationship with the donor, joins the call or participates in the modification discussions. If the modification request is approved, Grants Compliance works with the donor to complete the modification to the grant. While some modifications may be specific to the program or the budget, Grants Compliance facilitates the conversation and execution of the agreements. # Initiated by donor\n\nThe donor may request a modification to the grant at any time. The donor typically expresses this to the Program Lead. It is the responsibility of the Program Lead to begin copying the GLT Program Lead, Grants Compliance, and Program Finance when modifications to the grant begin. Unless the discussions are specifically and solely related to program and program deliverables, Grants Compliance will facilitate the conversation with the donor and the execution of the amendment. # No-Cost Extensions (NCE)\n\nA no-cost extension is a type of amendment that specifically (and solely) extends the end date of an agreement with a donor that does not entail any changes to the following:\n\n1.

NCE should be discussed with donors as soon as the need for the extension is recognized if strategic, but at least 3 months in advance, when possible. Page 21\n---\n# Grant Management Procedures\n\n# Non-Competing Extension (NCE)\n\nWhen a NCE is necessary, the Program Lead or Program Finance emails GLT Program Lead and Grants Compliance before contacting the donor. The request for a NCE must be approved by the GLT Program lead. If approved, Grants Compliance emails the donor with the request and copies Program Lead and Program Finance. Alternatively, depending on the relationship with the donor, it may be more appropriate for the Grants Compliance to set-up a call with the donor and Program Lead to discuss. If the NCE is agreed to, the Grants Compliance facilitates the signing of the NCE by the CFAO, if required by the funder. Grants Compliance is responsible for emailing finance@evidenceaction.org the fully executed NCE. Grants Compliance also saves the NCE in the “Agreement” folder in Box for the correct grant and updates the “End Date” for the grant in Salesforce and any payment or reporting schedule deadlines. # Grant Renewals\n\n# Grant Renewal Checklist\n\n# Process\n\nMany donors prefer to renew an existing grant with an amendment rather than create a new grant each year or program cycle. Award renewals generally consist of an extension to the agreement, a new budget with additional funding, and new deliverables. In many ways, a renewal is not dissimilar from entering into a new agreement, and thus communication with the donor should be treated as such, meaning that Grants Compliance should be copied on all emails related to the agreement, Program Finance copied on all emails related to the budget, and the GLT Program Lead should be copied or blind copied on all emails to the donor where a request or formal decision is being made related to the renewal. Frequently, donors require a concept note to be submitted before a grant is renewed. The creation of the concept note is facilitated by the Program Lead.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dPmXenksSt9QJtfXpfirS2eAAZ9zXM8AZ7yZHGdYJoA="},"dda5778f-9db6-4cf0-be2c-e8114c0e7df3":{"id_":"dda5778f-9db6-4cf0-be2c-e8114c0e7df3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Grants Management Procedures.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"kBUDl8ANujtTlX1W2SLNbr60ZowdQ6SLjp/6CrdSht0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"83e052d8-bca8-40a1-a875-2e6cf96dd3b3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Grants Management Procedures.pdf","file_name":"Grants Management Procedures.pdf"},"hash":"dPmXenksSt9QJtfXpfirS2eAAZ9zXM8AZ7yZHGdYJoA="}},"text":"The creation of the concept note is facilitated by the Program Lead.

Grants Compliance will send out a report once a quarter to GLT Program Lead, Program Lead, Program Finance, Global Finance, and Grants Budgets showing the grants that will be closing over the next 6 months, so everyone is aware of upcoming grant end dates. The grant close-out process begins 90 days prior to the end of a grant with Grants Compliance setting up a meeting with the Program Lead and Program Finance to review the Grant Closeout checklist.

The purpose of this policy is to safeguard all company information and data and to support the ongoing operations of Evidence Action. This policy applies to all Evidence Action employees. Use of Evidence Action systems constitutes consent to these guidelines and an understanding that possible disciplinary action may occur if misuse or abuse of these systems is discovered. # 2. POLICY\n\n# Background\n\nEvidence Action makes use of a variety of data to create information relating to its operations and programs. Evidence Action collects and stores information of many types in a variety of formats. The relative importance and sensitivity of this information varies and is subject to Evidence Action’s Information Classification procedure. # 5. COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING\n\n..............................................................................................................................................................................16\n\n# 6. APPENDICES\n\n..............................................................................................................................................................................17\n\n- Appendix A - Guidance for On/Offboarding ............................................................................................................17\n- Appendix B - Annual Review Checklist.....................................................................................................................17\n- Appendix C - Information Retention Schedule ........................................................................................................17\n- Appendix D - Country-Specific Regulatory Considerations ......................................................................................17\n- Appendix E - Data Protection Impact Assessment...................................................................................................17\n---\nIn collecting and using this information, Evidence Action is subject to legislation, regulations, and funder/partner rules controlling how this information can be handled and the safeguards that must be put in place to protect it. Evidence Action also believes in the inherent value of safeguarding information and therefore abides by additional best practice even when not legally or contractually required to do so. Sensitive organizational information must be protected from loss of integrity, confidentiality, or availability. The risks of inadequate access controls range from inconvenience to critical loss or corruption of information. It is important that Evidence Action information is – as far as it can be protected from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorized access, and unauthorized release. A range of controls are used to ensure information security including backups, identify management, and encryption. # 2.1 Principles of Information Management\n\nThere are a number of key principles that must be adopted when creating a compliant information management environment.

Content Owners (CO) are ultimately responsible for ensuring teams’ compliance with the IM Policy and empowering their Content Manager(s) to effectively implement the IM Policy. Content Owners make the final decision on information access, classification, and use. They are not usually involved with the day to day administration of the IM Policy within their team. - Approve authorized users access to folders and files with confidential information. Remain aware of information sharing and access permissions and work closely with the Content Manager to maintain compliance with the IM Policy. - Understand where confidential information is in their team’s folder structure. ---\n# Information Management Policy\n\n# Roles and Responsibilities\n\n- Approve access to Confidential information for internal users and access to all External party access. - Resolve issues that the Content Manager escalates to them. - Approve or reject, in consultation with GO, any Waiver Requests for the IM Policy. In most cases, the IM Policy will be flexible and a waiver may not be necessary. # Content Managers (CM)\n\nContent Managers (CM) administer information management policies and guidelines for a designated group of information. They are the point person on their team for understanding and implementing the Information Management policy. A team may have more than one Content Manager. - Ensure access to and sharing of their team’s information in compliance with information classifications.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"L0VESH+zajwgXW9Z50nFef7uYe4U2oC03wBEdIVkwYc="},"27bfbc36-6b97-41c5-a518-1e15383806bd":{"id_":"27bfbc36-6b97-41c5-a518-1e15383806bd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"VbbU83yZMpt1o6APOBWxwVwbg5vs+XhNzqWgQl6roV4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"adba08f9-0e4f-4736-a55e-464aed49abcc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"L0VESH+zajwgXW9Z50nFef7uYe4U2oC03wBEdIVkwYc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8584ec99-3e36-40bd-8bdc-8ccea0167758","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"jiWDmLYBVBeJd6EKKUOvrekuaCVCEHQ99toKyBfuAgE="}},"text":"- Ensure access to and sharing of their team’s information in compliance with information classifications. - The CM should consult with the CO before granting access to:\n- A third party external to Evidence Action\n- Any confidential information owned by the team\n- Administer information lifecycle - including organization, categorization, access, storage, and removal/archival for information generated by their team. - Conduct Annual Review in consultation with GO to ensure compliance with both in-country regulations and the IM policy. - Understand waterfall and sharing permissions on Box. - Ensure implementation of IM Policy requirements. - Support on/offboarding of staff within their team (see Appendix A for guidance on On/offboarding). # Ownership\n\n‘Ownership’ refers to the department/team that is responsible for a set of information - including managing user access, maintaining the folder structure, and reviewing information flagged for disposal.

Global Operations will work with Content Managers to determine when the review will take place. Global Operations will help Content Managers complete the review for their area of responsibility, using the Annual Review Checklist in Appendix B as a guide. The review reports shall be documented, stored within the Global Operations’ files and shared with Content Owners. ---\n# 2.2 Information Creation & Collection\n\nEmployees at Evidence Action should use approved applications when creating, composing, and editing documents and information.

This policy applies to information in all formats or media. Information assets are classified according to the risks associated with information being stored or processed. Information with the highest risk needs the greatest level of protection to prevent compromise; information with lower risk requires proportionately less protection. Three levels of classification will be used to classify information based on how the information is used, its sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure, and requirements imposed upon its care of use. The purpose of these information classification categories is to guide employees’ routine interaction with Evidence Action information. These guidelines apply to all types of information Evidence Action uses globally. If there are questions regarding the proper handling and use of information, an employee should direct questions to Global Operations. # Information Classifications\n\nCompany information can generally be categorized in three ways; employees should assess the information they interact with and handle it in accordance with the respective security control guidelines. # I. Public\n\nInformation explicitly or implicitly approved for distribution to the public without restriction. It can be freely distributed without potential harm to Evidence Action, donors, affiliates, or individuals. Public information generally has a very low sensitivity since by definition there is no such thing as unauthorized disclosure, but it still\n---\n# I.

Internal information is generally not made available to parties outside of Evidence Action. Unauthorized disclosure could adversely impact the company, donors, affiliates, or individuals. Internal data generally have a low to moderate sensitivity. Examples include: financial accounting data not containing confidential information; company intranet; programmatic data that doesn't contain PII; company strategic plans; HR, IT, or other company policy documents. # III.

All files and other electronic documents related to Evidence Action business are to be stored in the appropriate location within Box. In limited cases, if a file cannot be stored on Box, a bookmark should be put in Box to direct users to the file location (i.e. Google Drive). A key advantage of Box is visibility and long-term continuity. Because Box is centrally managed and owned, files are more easily found by employees. When an employee departs Evidence Action, their files remain in Box for future discoverability. Evidence Action’s secondary file collaboration system is Google Drive.

Country-level storage: If country data regulations apply to the information, then information should be held in a structure allowing for country-specific controls. (i.e. PII to be held in in-country servers or in country-specific Box folders)\n2. Least Permission Possible: Staff should have the least permission level possible to perform their duties, only content authorized for company-wide sharing should be accessible to all staff. 3. Classification: All Confidential folders should be clearly marked as much. All folders without an explicit classification shall be classified as Internal by default. Evidence Action-Administered Systems: Content should only be stored on Evidence Action Administered systems (i.e. Box, Google Drive, etc. )\n4. Designated Ownership and Management: Information will have at least one designated Content Owner and one designated Content Manager.

It is permissible for employees to temporarily store files Locally on their device. Should an employee’s device become compromised due to a crash, virus, loss or theft the employee understands that those files could be lost. Employees are prohibited from permanently storing Evidence Action files on personal devices or any other non-approved service. Please see the Global IT Policy (IT.GL.06) for more information on use of personal devices. Where information is legally (or practically) required to be stored on paper or another non-electronic medium (e.g.: photographs, textile, etc.), adequate precautions must be taken to ensure that environmental conditions remain suitable for the type of material used. Where possible, digital backup copies of such information should be made by scanning or photographing the items. If the original paper copies are not needed and the digital record is sufficient, the original paper copy should be destroyed. Regular checks must be made to assess the rate of deterioration of the material and action taken to preserve the items as required in accordance with the Information Retention and Destruction Policy (section 2.6).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GTrO6kZZAS4RJzg2XfjcUIF8lPXCyqWl1rQkZrik8xo="},"ac8f5be4-3ced-45c2-873c-1f868fd11f9e":{"id_":"ac8f5be4-3ced-45c2-873c-1f868fd11f9e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"VbbU83yZMpt1o6APOBWxwVwbg5vs+XhNzqWgQl6roV4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"752ceb90-ff1a-4b51-bcb4-27094f250f04","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"GTrO6kZZAS4RJzg2XfjcUIF8lPXCyqWl1rQkZrik8xo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c59c065f-7910-4b02-8125-3ec939401d65","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"xF5qzqdfHXql6m01XmpMIlPQLKvvpeGVDFUAwqWS24U="}},"text":"# Staff Working Folders\n\nAt the time of onboarding, a ‘staff working folder’ shall be set up for each individual by Box Admin.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis policy contains guidelines that will be applied when a staff moves from one job to another within Evidence Action. It outlines the requirements needed for such moves and the considerations for salary determination. The policy also contains guidelines on determining salaries for new entrants into Evidence Action. Evidence Action cares deeply about creating pathways for our staff to build their careers within the organization as it is a powerful mechanism to support organizational and individual growth. # Employment changes benefit the organization, staff, and managers in the following ways:\n\n- Organization: High quality internal candidates can increase their scope and/or fill urgent openings in the organization and their internal knowledge and skills can be quickly leveraged. This allows Evidence Action to increase our impact and hone in on employees’ available skill sets. - Staff: The opportunity to explore new roles internally gives staff the flexibility to grow in their careers and deliver more impact during their time at Evidence Action. It can also improve job satisfaction, support staff’s personal needs, and help achieve their learning goals. - Managers: Having an Employment Change Policy allows us to maintain an on-going talent pipeline, drive staff engagement, and reduce turnovers if staff are seeking external opportunities. Typically, an internal role is filled in half the time as an external role which allows more time to complete department priorities. # 2. DEFINITIONS\n\nAt Evidence Action, staff have the opportunity to move into new roles in the following ways: promotion, lateral transfer, or a competitive internal recruitment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XuMPk+awZSViZXMeHcGOSbPrwMLpqaOhFvnpLpKv28E="},"623b6eac-c4fb-46fe-9f31-87fb5e0cd99d":{"id_":"623b6eac-c4fb-46fe-9f31-87fb5e0cd99d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"y8f3Qgi+IsADfCNjt0xNRRJqD5fr3HAJkOjI19DLZPc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"77cc46be-106c-4905-b68b-e357845f8470","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"XuMPk+awZSViZXMeHcGOSbPrwMLpqaOhFvnpLpKv28E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cd6eaf87-1773-49d0-aa9e-fdaf6b690c85","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"sxn9fh1B1xaz6MUYgrb4A1cishdmhwBOIuR3M1Cfcgo="}},"text":"Internal mobility may occur when:\n\n- A job opening is advertised internally as well as externally or a position opens up and Evidence Action wants to fill it from within,\n- And the employee has consistently good performance evaluations and their manager deems them ready for the next step in their career. # This table outlines classifications for a promotion, lateral transfer, or a competitive internal recruitment:\n\n|Employment change|Definition|When|\n|---|---|---|\n|Competitive internal recruitment|Refers to the competitive internal recruitment process where there is an opportunity to fill a job vacancy with an existing employee.

SCOPE\n\nThis policy applies to all employees who have completed at least one year of service at Evidence Action.

Lateral transfers allow Evidence Action to have a more flexible workforce. Country, department, or program leadership can request lateral transfers. To implement a lateral transfer for an employee, the sending and receiving managers should follow this process:\n\n- The receiving manager should outline the desired job, location, duration of the assignment (permanent transfer or rotational), and expected outcomes of the role in a job description format. - The receiving manager should discuss the role with the sending manager for further alignment and to determine how the employee’s current role will be completed prior to the new rotational agreement. - The sending manager and receiving manager should meet with P&C to discuss implications of the transfer. - The employee, sending, and receiving manager should meet to discuss the possibility of job rotation or role shift, the assigned duties, time frames, schedules, hours, etc., so that details can be negotiated and arranged. A lateral transfer can be denied if it cannot be balanced with the needs of Evidence Action. - The receiving manager should complete a Internal Mobility Request Form. - Finalize the lateral transfer with P&C and receive final approval. - P&C and the receiving manager should update all relevant systems with the shifted employee details.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Fa6e4eoxt23hxB8NbBt4+ovPVwKW2mzWoEf1V6y0iAI="},"b6e82a3e-66fa-475a-b35a-6fc84f787f98":{"id_":"b6e82a3e-66fa-475a-b35a-6fc84f787f98","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"y8f3Qgi+IsADfCNjt0xNRRJqD5fr3HAJkOjI19DLZPc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fcdf917a-7c0f-4099-bf7a-57debbd4db01","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"Fa6e4eoxt23hxB8NbBt4+ovPVwKW2mzWoEf1V6y0iAI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ffd7bfff-7bd4-4567-bd4c-2c54025d2200","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"WbstLczBIoWaiAHtMdbzZ1EOrlryF7Gmx+5E2ihJWVg="}},"text":"- P&C and the receiving manager should update all relevant systems with the shifted employee details.

The success of our compensation program hinges on our ability to appropriately compete with external labour markets, to recognize and reward exceptional performance, and to maintain a shared understanding of internal equity and fairness. # Determining new hire starting salary\n\nAll new hire salaries will be evaluated based on their relevant knowledge, skills and experience as it relates to the minimally required knowledge, skills and experience of the position to which they are applying. Salaries for a new hire should be at the minimum of the payband, and where flexibility is required, not exceed the midpoint of their salary range. The recruitment team will screen candidates and ensure that we are only engaging candidates who are within the range of the minimum and midpoint of the bands. This allows the new employee an opportunity for future growth within the salary range. Other factors to consider:\n\n- Job value: Each job is assigned a job level, based on the job description and the analysis of industry pay rates for similar jobs. Additional consideration may be given for jobs with hard to find skills and/or the job’s overall value to achieving the organizational goals. Africa region has staff in two categories either Country staff or Technical Track staff. - Individual value: The value that the individual brings to the job based on their relevant skills and experience. Less skilled and experienced applicants should be paid lower in the range, while more skilled and experienced applicants would be paid higher in the range, though not always above the midpoint or at the max of the pay band. ---\n# Internal equity\n\nA review of salaries of current employees in similar positions will be completed to ensure internal equity. Please Note: Any starting salary above the midpoint of the salary band will require justification and review by the Associate Director P&C and approval by the Executive Vice President. # Job Promotion Salary Adjustments\n\nWhen an employee moves from their current position to a different position that is assigned to a higher pay band, this is considered a promotion. A promotion generally warrants an increase in base salary to recognize additional skills and/or responsibilities of the employee and to ensure that pay for the new position is consistent with market and internal equity.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"heS6DTIzuggoCxWY8YeXIVzCIIddllDMkaYV/h37xs4="},"d1d480b6-01ce-4715-b773-ccf08fef1481":{"id_":"d1d480b6-01ce-4715-b773-ccf08fef1481","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"y8f3Qgi+IsADfCNjt0xNRRJqD5fr3HAJkOjI19DLZPc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c569af97-51e3-4a67-a072-094fab741c94","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"heS6DTIzuggoCxWY8YeXIVzCIIddllDMkaYV/h37xs4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cc3923bf-4267-402c-a369-7c8f801cd9bf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Internal Mobility Policy - Africa_April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"1yvsqu3NXQYMetmb8dWgM3rbWxEV9ib5h/PnlXXK+Hg="}},"text":"# Determination of Promotional Increases\n\n- Promotional increases will be typically between 10%-20%, depending on the increased level of responsibility and other key considerations.

This policy applies to all Evidence Action employees. The purpose of this policy is to help ensure consistency in the use of Passwords and other authentication methods as the first line defense against unauthorized access to Evidence Action systems and data. # POLICY\n\nPasswords, Single Sign On (SSO), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are the key features of Evidence Action’s information and system security. They are the first line of protection for user accounts and organization data that may be accessed at any time from anywhere in the world. Access not secured with password and multifactor security, or configured to use SSO with Google accounts, may lead to the compromise of Evidence Action’s data, systems, proprietary information, and operational functionality. All systems must meet the following minimum organizational standards for access control:\n\n- A password length of 8 or more characters;\n- An annual password reset on the anniversary of last reset;\n- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) configured. If SSO configuration to Google Apps is available, access to systems should be configured accordingly. If SSO configuration to Google Apps is not possible, the minimum organizational standards above should be in effect.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1oERisB1kHESVh7WW+ygxMjTKfMcx4+ZbbGF8/Jdpbw="},"3c38bea1-0e06-4055-bc1c-c2d7e2f03724":{"id_":"3c38bea1-0e06-4055-bc1c-c2d7e2f03724","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"F2fHZv3DHrgaMS/Sxrnp6PdsZzh3gZ8bQFM/rwYGlN4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c58b316d-c479-4ac0-bd6e-e75b663c48db","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"1oERisB1kHESVh7WW+ygxMjTKfMcx4+ZbbGF8/Jdpbw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cf35b023-c46d-41f4-b910-ee4f7afa8646","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"bXIu9BlI//tFwfngMUbs0KexQg0SSUEEiBMR/xbOJpQ="}},"text":"# DEFINITIONS\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication – An extra layer of security that requires not only a Password and username but also something that only an individual user has on them; most commonly a mobile phone number that will receive a unique text code to verify the identity of the individual attempting to gain access. Password – A secret string of characters (or phrase) that must be used to gain admission to a computer, interface, or system. Password Management Software – An application that is used to store and manage the Passwords that a user has for various online accounts. Password Managers store the Passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the Password data with the help of a single master Password. One advantage of Password Managers is it enables the use of many highly complex (and difficult to remember) Passwords with the ease of a few clicks. Most Password Managers also assist in generating randomized complex passwords. Access Control – A security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. There are two main types of access control: physical and logical. Physical access control limits access to buildings, rooms and physical IT assets. Logical access control limits connections to computer networks, system files and data.

The ability to recover operations in such an event is therefore paramount. The IT department will partner with system administrators and owners to understand their system’s backup and restoration options, and to perform periodic per-system assessments with an eye towards automation, cost efficiency, and suitability. All systems at Evidence Action should have recovery planning in place, either as a service by the providers or configured internally in conjunction with the IT Department. Systems should allow for the single instance or total recovery of lost or modified data for at least 14 days.

The purpose of this policy is to define criteria for using and registering domain names and ensure the centralized management of domain names to maintain Evidence Action's identity. # Importance of evidenceaction.org Domain Name\n\nHaving a website with evidenceaction.org domain name enhances the credibility and legitimacy of Evidence Action compared to relying solely on social media platforms or using another entity's domain. The evidenceaction.org domain name provides a distinct identity and reinforces Evidence Action's presence on the internet. # Scope of the Policy\n\nThis policy applies to all new domain names registered after the effective date of this policy. It applies to domain names only and does not apply to web contents and where websites are hosted. # POLICY\n\n# Domain Name Registration\n\nEvidence Action requires all domain names to be registered through reputable domain registrars such as GoDaddy, Network Solutions, AWS, Microsoft, Google, etc. This ensures reliability and adherence to industry standards.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xkpQJ+snVSgQVit9erSOO+vYF4ZXj4kYTUV3sWTnb6o="},"d2d000a3-8396-40f2-b2a2-1238c8dde119":{"id_":"d2d000a3-8396-40f2-b2a2-1238c8dde119","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"F2fHZv3DHrgaMS/Sxrnp6PdsZzh3gZ8bQFM/rwYGlN4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9fe4496e-f637-4b5a-a712-154078ff065f","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"xkpQJ+snVSgQVit9erSOO+vYF4ZXj4kYTUV3sWTnb6o="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0e0969eb-7a08-4708-ac4b-6fa0c55d8ac3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"JQTk+sncnVpC/QFHzfOMK/+OBQaQqkkqt4sYlZiu3m0="}},"text":"This ensures reliability and adherence to industry standards. As Evidence Action continues to grow, it is necessary to:\n\n- Centralize all domain names: All domain names associated with Evidence Action must be managed and controlled centrally to maintain consistent branding and control over web properties. - Establish Evidence Action's identity: Registering domain names under the evidenceaction.org domain consolidates Evidence Action's online presence and strengthens its brand recognition. # Domain name registration requirements\n\nIt is recommended that Evidence Action web applications, websites, and any web presence utilize the evidenceaction.org domain name wherever possible. This can be achieved by requesting a subdomain from Evidence Action's Global IT team. For instance, instead of registering a new domain name like 'apps.org,' use the domain name 'apps.evidenceaction.org. ' In this example, 'apps' is a subdomain of the primary domain name evidenceaction.org. This approach ensures consistency, reinforces Evidence Action's identity, and eliminates the costs associated with registering new domain names. # Exceptions\n\nIn exceptional cases, there may arise situations where it is deemed necessary to register a new domain name. Such cases will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Page 17 of 19\n---\n# Evidence Action Global Information Technology Policies and Procedures Manual\n\n# DEFINITIONS\n\nDomain Name - an online web address used to uniquely identify a website. Each website has its own unique domain name. For Evidence Action, the official domain name is www.evidenceaction.org. # PROCEDURES\n\nTo register a new domain name, a request must be submitted to the Global IT team at helpdesk@evidenceaction.org. If an exception is requested, proper justification should be provided. If denied, the request will be escalated to the COO for further consideration. This process ensures careful consideration and maintains the centralized control of domain names. All new domain names must be registered by Global IT. By adhering to this Domain Name Registration Policy, Evidence Action ensures the centralized management of domain names, strengthens its online presence, and maintains consistency in branding across all web properties. # FURTHER INFORMATION\n\nFor additional information, please contact the IT Department. # HISTORY\n\nOrigin: 1 October 2023\n\nPage 18 of 19\n---\n# Evidence Action Global Information Technology Policies and Procedures Manual\n\n# Appendix A.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"T3AtmkdzGtZEhrTXCEAMzv2ohjVosepbrd1+xCTSRYQ="},"0e0969eb-7a08-4708-ac4b-6fa0c55d8ac3":{"id_":"0e0969eb-7a08-4708-ac4b-6fa0c55d8ac3","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"F2fHZv3DHrgaMS/Sxrnp6PdsZzh3gZ8bQFM/rwYGlN4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d2d000a3-8396-40f2-b2a2-1238c8dde119","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"T3AtmkdzGtZEhrTXCEAMzv2ohjVosepbrd1+xCTSRYQ="}},"text":"Communications Systems in Use at Evidence Action\n\n|Communication Channel|Notes|\n|---|---|\n|Email (@evidenceaction.org or @eaiiadvisors.in)|Used by all employees, the company’s official communication medium.

For instance, systems housing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without IT admin access, lacking Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2-FA), are vulnerable to compromise and data breaches. To address these concerns, IT Governance serves as a health check for critical systems, involving a structured assessment where IT poses carefully crafted questions to system owners. These questions cover aspects such as access control, business continuity, risk management, sysadmin roles, and cybersecurity. Each query is assigned a weight, and upon completion, IT furnishes a comprehensive report card to system owners. Using the scoring system, IT collaborates with system owners to develop a compliance roadmap, ensuring alignment with organizational standards and mitigating potential risks. # IT Risk Management Services\n\nIT risk management at Evidence Action is a vital service delivered by the IT team, aimed at evaluating the risks associated with mission-critical systems. The primary objective is to identify potential risks and propose effective mitigation strategies to ensure uninterrupted business operations. Each regional IT team is tasked with assessing the risks related to mission-critical systems specific to their respective regions. These region-specific risk assessments are then integrated into the overall organizational risk assessment framework. This integration not only offers a comprehensive view of the organization's risk landscape but also enhances transparency and instills confidence in the management team's decision-making process. # System Integration Services\n\nIT offers system integration services tailored to specific needs, spanning from consultation to hands-on implementation, depending on available resources and the complexity of requests. These services encompass a broad spectrum of activities, including system consolidation and configuration, integration of both physical and cloud infrastructure, implementation of Single Sign-On across various systems, and the integration of communication systems and Artificial Intelligence, among others.

The purpose of Evidence Action People & Culture Policies and Procedures is to ensure that there is a uniform, fair, equitable, and objective way of managing People & Culture issues at Evidence Action. Evidence Action People & Culture Policies and Procedures serve as a reference for employees for their responsibilities, rights, and obligations and as a guide for managers in the administration of People & Culture Management and Administration. The provisions contained in these policies and procedures apply, in addition to the rules and regulations of applicable labor laws, with regards to the obligations and rights of employees. Any additions or modifications shall be subject to approval by the Evidence Action Executive Vice President in consultation with the Regional People & Culture Office. These People & Culture Policies and Procedures, together with the Global People & Culture Policies, establish the terms and conditions of employment for Evidence Action personnel. They are aimed at achieving a balanced and cordial working environment for employees in order to maintain high levels of job productivity and satisfaction. Where provisions of this Evidence Action People & Culture Policies and Procedures differ from those stated in Evidence Action employment agreements, the employment agreement shall prevail. # Mission and Core Values\n\nOur vision, mission, and values are the core tenets of Evidence Action. They were approved by resolution of the Board of Directors at their May 2017 meeting, and are the result of an extensive process of consultation among staff, leadership, and Board members. What we discovered through this exercise was a deep sense of alignment on the organization’s purpose and the principles driving our work. These three components serve as the foundation for our organizational culture and strategy for the years ahead. # Our Vision\n\nBuilding a world where hundreds of millions of people in the poorest places have better opportunities and their lives are measurably improved. # Our Mission\n\nEvidence Action aims to be a world leader in scaling evidence-based and cost-effective programs to reduce the burden of poverty – defines how we contribute to that vision. ---\n# Our Values\n\n1.

Managers are encouraged to utilize the guidance approach for cases of minor misconduct. In this case, the manager shall have a conversation with the employee outlining the nature of the problem and providing a suggested approach to prevent its recurrence. The purpose is to provide guidance on expected performance or conduct, and agree on a timeframe for expected changes. The conversation must take place immediately after the offense. Even though these corrections are regarded as informal, the manager documents the conversation and agreed action points. While these informal corrections are reserved for those situations deemed to be clear misunderstanding or mistakes, failure to respond appropriately or repetition of the same mistake will inevitably result in more serious disciplinary actions. # II. Official Warnings\n\nAn official warning is formal and is used for misconduct that constitutes a problem that Evidence Action cannot accept. The purpose of official warning is to stop the misconduct and inform the employee that continued violation or poor performance will have consequences for continued employment with Evidence Action. When an employee commits a misconduct, the manager is responsible to define an appropriate response. The manager notifies and consults with People and Culture to confirm whether the misconduct warrants an official warning as the appropriate response. The manager must hold a conversation with the employee to inform him/her that the misconduct is unacceptable, after giving the employee an opportunity to explain himself (in writing). If the employee’s explanation is unsatisfactory, the manager informs the employee that an official warning will be issued. The warning letter is drafted by People & Culture in consultation with the line manager and endorsed by the Country Director. Once reviewed, the manager signs the warning letter and calls for a face-to-face meeting with the employee to issue the warning letter. A People and Culture representative must be present in the meeting. The employee is expected to sign the warning letter within 72 hours, a signed copy is kept in his/her personnel file. An official warning letter is void after a period of one year provided the employee does not commit further misconduct. If an employee who has already received two warnings commits a third misconduct, he shall be liable to summary dismissal which shall be carried out in accordance with the stipulated procedure. # Content of Official Warning\n\n- The nature of violation i.e.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"DBet4eDhhPKK+OsEWfhAHE5/PJHRIDWWNZSmdKbHh+Q="},"2ee1746d-5eeb-47a7-bbef-ebca8cdd7454":{"id_":"2ee1746d-5eeb-47a7-bbef-ebca8cdd7454","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"6LxvHNchnIAdMpUlQdfIb/j4ujqhQIUZc4NDLeyrRcc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b10cad3c-5b77-468d-8ef9-290ce44c02c0","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"DBet4eDhhPKK+OsEWfhAHE5/PJHRIDWWNZSmdKbHh+Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d791a46e-d02a-4405-bba5-09e66c02d003","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf","file_name":"Kenya NRS POLICY April 2024.pdf"},"hash":"UgHK5YUJvxFoXPAhOZkFHEC88UDXavZfuOiMLZGYF2U="}},"text":"# Content of Official Warning\n\n- The nature of violation i.e. the specific rule violated or performance problem;\n- Reference to the conversation meeting with the employee, including any statements made by the employee during the meeting;\n- Statement on what management expects on the employee’s behavior or performance;\n- Timeframe for achieving the expected improvement or changes;\n---\n- Follow-up meeting to review progress;\n- Any support (where relevant) that Evidence Action will provide to assist the employee;\n- Statement that repeated misconduct or poor performance will result in further disciplinary action including termination of contract;\n\nThe fact that the employee does not have the same understanding as his/her manager on their performance or misconduct has no effect on the validity of the warning.

This policy and the accompanying regulations are proposed for the purpose of establishing and standardizing the procurement procedures across all Evidence Action, Africa Region projects and departments to achieve the following objectives:\n\n1. Maximize value for money\n2. Promote supplier competition\n3. Promote integrity and fairness of procurement procedures\n4. Ensure transparency, clarity and accountability in these procedures\n5. Ensure there is staff confidence in these procedures. 6. Ensure there is efficiency in the operations\n7. Conform to both Kenyan law and donor demands on best practices. This policy will cover purchase of goods and services paid for through Evidence Action accounts. The amounts referred to in this policy relate to each single purchase (invoice amount). All cash purchases and accompanying provisions will be guided by the Evidence Action cash imprest management guidelines while disciplinary procedures will refer to procedures as outlined in the Human Resource Policy. # POLICY\n\nPolicy Reference: PRO.KE.01\n\nEffective Date: 1 October 2022\n\nOrigin: 1 July 2017\n\nRevision: 29th April 2024\n\nAt Evidence Action, our policy documents often include multiple policies collated into one document. In this case, it’s important that each policy, or “section” include a specific policy reference, origin date, and effective date. It’s useful to track this information by policy section as there are cases where portions of a policy are revised and approved, while the other sections remain unchanged.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ot9pibwD5BXbkTt4VNNAtHqiQQYKMcCxKKv3yBPteJo="},"0f4001cf-6cb0-412b-85b8-a5305a6b3243":{"id_":"0f4001cf-6cb0-412b-85b8-a5305a6b3243","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\KENYA PROCUREMENT policy.

The PRF is used to initiate all purchases. The PRF can be prepared by any Evidence Action staff, but has to be approved by the budget holder. The Originator of the PRF should provide specifications for the goods/services required. The Completed PRF with accompanying documentation is the authorization for the procurement department to initiate the purchase process. # Request for Quotation Form (RFQ)\n\nThis is the document used to solicit for standardized quotes from Suppliers to allow for “apple to apples” comparison. Procurement Officers should use it to provide information to vendors, including but not limited to quantity, description, delivery requirements, special conditions, drawings, specifications, quotation due date. Vendors should then respond by providing quotations in line with the specification listed on the form, or provide a stamped RFQ in lieu of Quotations (in the event that the Vendor does not have a valid quotation). # Quotation\n\nA formal statement of promise (usually submitted in response to a request for quotation) by a potential supplier to supply the goods or services required by a buyer, at specified prices, and within a specified period. A quotation may also contain terms of sale and payment, and warranties. # Pro Forma Invoice\n\nA proforma invoice is not a true invoice – it is simply a document that declares the seller’s commitment to provide the goods or services specified to the buyer at certain prices. # Invoice\n\nThis is an itemized bill for goods sold or services provided, containing individual prices, the total charge, and the terms. This is a request by the seller for payment for goods and or services derived. The finance team will require the invoice for payments. Both hard copy and digital versions of invoices are considered acceptable. # Quotation Analysis Form (QA)\n\nThis form is used to compare quotes/bids received from vendors and justify the selection of the vendor. The form should be completed for purchases worth the equivalent of USD $1,000 and more, except when ordering from preferred suppliers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KxYb1ZLnZZyQVbjx66rWjO0DkLHuunOaSjWcahRogLk="},"32440e95-8618-44d7-a568-d6faf813a5d4":{"id_":"32440e95-8618-44d7-a568-d6faf813a5d4","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\KENYA PROCUREMENT policy.

Planning must include the goods, services and work description, the quantity, the period of the planned procurement and the key action dates. It is the responsibility of the program manager to prepare a Project Procurement Plan (PPP) each year. At this stage the program teams have to provide clear information on items specification, quantity, and timing of supplies to the procurement team using the Project Procurement Plan. The Project Procurement Plan is an important supply management tool as it helps the procurement team to:\n\n- Anticipate the needs per activity/team/month. - Anticipate whether various submarkets need to be consolidated (i.e. for several projects starting at the same time) and to prevent the unnecessary market split. - Negotiate prices and conditions with the suppliers based on higher quantities. - Have an overview of the procurement activities over the year. Define which procurement procedures should be launched for each item/set of interrelated items. The PPP should be reviewed quarterly by all staff involved in its preparation and more frequently if required to ensure any new needs are captured and incorporated in the plan. # PROCEDURES\n\n# INITIATING THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS\n\nAll procurement requests will be initiated by the PRF. Typically the Program Managers, Program Directors/Program Leads, Senior Associates, and Administrative Officers will fill out the PRFs. This function will be coordinated by the Procurement Officer.

The suppliers on record will be used until the end of the current year unless changes in terms require immediate action. The new list of suppliers becomes effective at the start of the New Year. Exceptions should be made in cases where the new suppliers have exceptionally better terms than the existing ones on record. # At the year-end meeting the Tender Committee will do the following:\n\n- Develop standards for evaluating and ranking suppliers – the variables and respective importance\n- Review existing Preferred Supplier List to confirm membership or remove nonperforming suppliers\n- Review all requests for admission onto the Preferred Supplier List. - Review and discuss feedback from the procurement process. - Review the different limits and approvals and propose amendments as needed to improve efficiency and operations. # Changes in the Preferred List of Suppliers\n\nA change in the terms, including price and payment periods will necessitate a review of suppliers in a given category and/or location. The supplier in question will be given the chance to provide new terms. If the new terms are not agreeable to Evidence Action the supplier should be removed from the Preferred Supplier List after approval of the removal by the DFO. In the interim, Procurement Officers will look into finding a new primary supplier and the second best and/or third best fit supplier should be used until the Procurement committee is done with the review of new suppliers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LbepmaBc0TLbWApbBtqrJnkPFK31VhsCUjP3GrxeJf4="},"d932ec55-fda6-43fe-8138-7a346ef0e7a1":{"id_":"d932ec55-fda6-43fe-8138-7a346ef0e7a1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\KENYA PROCUREMENT policy.

The Procurement Officer will keep a record of all POs issued, identifying the supplier in receipt of the PO. The Procurement Officer will also track the value of the PO and internal approver. This list should be available at all times for review by the Regional Director and DFO as needed. At the end of each month the Procurement Officer will provide Senior Management with a Summary Status of all PO’s issued. Between official reports, a working document will be made available to Procurement Officers in all offices to input tracking. To take care of the satellite offices and avoid conflict in the serialization of the PO, each satellite office will separately track POs issued at that office. The Serialization of POs will have a prefix to indicate from which office the PO originated. Manual tracking may only be used when the online Process Maker system is dysfunctional. The DFO and Associate Administration will have full access to this, to query and clean up transactions as needed. # Purchase Order Approval and Corresponding Authorization Limits\n\n- Between the equivalent of USD $1-$10,000: Budget Holder approval then to the program leads\n- Between the equivalent of USD $10,001-$20,000: budget holder approval, then the Country leads.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uYdUWEJoT7tCywzIwBRy0Tf7lBZwZ1TKJ1IgWAlFwcQ="},"967a6f70-de03-43bf-ab26-44a0ccee22cb":{"id_":"967a6f70-de03-43bf-ab26-44a0ccee22cb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\KENYA PROCUREMENT policy.

This policy applies to both Regional Shared Costs for Africa Region as a whole and also to the Sub-Regional Shared Cost pools for both East & South Africa Sub-Region as well as West & Central Africa Sub-Region:\n\nIn principle as much as feasible, we shall aim to have more costs directly charged to programs at the country level. It is only for costs that are hard to attribute to a specific program either in part or as a whole, that the pooled methods come into effect:\n\n# DEFINITION OF REGIONS AND SUB-REGIONS\n\n# Regional Africa\n\nThis is defined as the entire Africa Region as a continent. Evidence Action has operations in Africa and is currently in five countries. # East & South Africa Sub-Region Hub\n\nThis hub comprises the countries of Kenya, Uganda, Malawi; and other countries which may be added in the future in this hub. # West & Central Africa Hub\n---\n# This hub comprises the countries of Nigeria, Liberia, and other countries which may be added in the future in this hub:\n\n# POLICY\n\nAssigning expenses to projects using a methodology that is consistent and rational will provide Evidence Action management with the true cost of each project being implemented. The objective of cost allocation is to charge expenses to Evidence Action projects based on the benefit that each project receives from the expense incurred. Using documented and systematic methods to allocate shared costs shall ensure that each Evidence Action donor covers its \"fair share\" of allocable expenses. Allocating shared costs also helps to improve project management through funding sources. An effective cost allocation system will enable fair and reasonable distribution of allocable operational costs across all Evidence Action complying with donor regulations and assist in maintaining a consistent, reasonable, and reliable financial accounting management system.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"E0eJYzOe/M+we6c7vXLKEGfsZ3dGpMWf6G9ZP1LCyGo="},"345df0a6-c01c-4fd8-a162-5b6a039847a6":{"id_":"345df0a6-c01c-4fd8-a162-5b6a039847a6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"hash":"3KuQuiI4tORVRKs5vOb8WiSy+qfsHV3nAwasMkZ1MxU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"60e6ecc3-1213-4ebc-87bb-0a7c001ea96e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"hash":"E0eJYzOe/M+we6c7vXLKEGfsZ3dGpMWf6G9ZP1LCyGo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8ef99876-57e1-43f1-9b6d-574bb6cbca73","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"hash":"PeK1ftDaaHWZkJnvfV65EKl9PdfzT15MxvQ9C5tFcX4="}},"text":"# Principles\n\nLogic shall be applied and the criteria chosen shall be justifiable when allocating shared costs to projects.

Defining Cost Drivers. The \"fair share\" is normally calculated by defining the cost driver. 2. Determining which costs are Shared Costs. Some examples of Shared Costs that normally benefit multiple projects are utility bills; office supplies; office rent; management and administrative staff salaries. 3. Establishing an auditable system to determine Shared Costs and Cost Allocation policies and procedures. 4. Using Cost Allocation policies and procedures consistently throughout the fiscal year. 5.

Country Offices Shared Cost Pool\n2. Engineering Direct Shared Cost Pool\n\n# 1. Background\n\nWith the growth in Uganda and Malawi country programs, following the expansion of the number of dispensers and with the recent funding announcement, it has become necessary to rethink the sharing of the country office costs. The expansion might increase in the next few months if other programs are layered on becomes equally significant. Currently, the F&A and HR costs mostly at the Country offices for example Kampala and Lilongwe (more Country Field offices can be added as required), are all billed directly to the current dispensers program. With the anticipated growth, and with a need to differentiate between the costs benefiting the current and the expanded footprint, it is necessary to design a mechanism of splitting these costs in a fair and consistent manner. Currently, we foresee mainly the F&A Teams (including administrative teams) and HR teams, as well as the Country Lead/Director to be the main support anchors of the program from these country offices. The members of these teams will mainly offer Administrative, Accounting, Human resources, and logistical support. Central offices also offer physical office space, and other logistical support to other team members e.g. country leadership, MLE, and other staff members. This document highlights how to approach the treatment of Shared Country Offices Costs and shared Engineering Direct Shared costs. It does not however include the Regional Costs allocation, whose treatment approach has already been documented. # 2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sbIKdJWklXBz4qJTh6D2EWp1bKJDuPqFTYlKgPosgd0="},"bd53308c-2da9-41aa-807c-37c3d844ec9e":{"id_":"bd53308c-2da9-41aa-807c-37c3d844ec9e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"hash":"3KuQuiI4tORVRKs5vOb8WiSy+qfsHV3nAwasMkZ1MxU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9e619125-328a-489f-b019-d5cd4b653a87","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"hash":"sbIKdJWklXBz4qJTh6D2EWp1bKJDuPqFTYlKgPosgd0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5f1ff137-d8ae-4842-b384-79652792a30e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatbot-SSO-AR\\EvidenceActionChatbot-Africa-v2\\data\\Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf","file_name":"Liberia Finance Procedures Manual for Finance Team - effective 20230101.pdf"},"hash":"rL2QhWT7IWjK/MHq5ghx4NSSWos5q7Or0/icAD7a89E="}},"text":"# 2.
