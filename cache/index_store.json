Employees should maintain visual and physical control of Company Equipment while traveling. Employees are not permitted to download software requiring administrative access to Company Equipment without consultation with the IT department. Company Equipment in use by an employee is to be returned upon completion of their employment. All Company Equipment must have up-to-date Antivirus, Antimalware, Endpoint Security and Management Software installed and actively protected. This is the responsibility of the IT department. ---\n# Evidence Action Global Information Technology Policies and Procedures Manual\n\nThe use of personal devices is allowed at Evidence Action subject to the guidelines found in the Bring Your Own Device Policy (IT.GL.06). Procurement of equipment such as laptops, monitors, printers, and computers will be as standardized as possible to ensure consistency with the brand and model of equipment used at Evidence Action. The IT department will provide guidance on the specifications, brand, model, and pricing of equipment to be procured. While availability of equipment can vary by locality, all attempts should be made to conform as closely as possible to the recommended equipment. When purchasing equipment such as laptops, it is strongly advised to secure a warranty of 3 years or more to match the anticipated useful life span of the equipment. All laptops, computers, tablets, smartphones, printers and other equipment should be recorded and tracked in an equipment/asset inventory. This is the responsibility of the IT department with support from administrative staff in some regions. Pertinent equipment data that is captured should include manufacturer, model, serial numbers, purchase data, system hardware configuration, software configuration, operating system, general specs, warranty information, employee assignment, physical office location, and any other relevant notes regarding purchase date, access or usage. All laptops, computers, tablets or smartphones procured by Evidence Action must have an asset tag affixed. This is the responsibility of the IT department with support from administrative staff in some regions. The asset tag’s unique number should be recorded in the centralized equipment/asset inventory. No individual should access Company Equipment without prior approval from the employee, and will only use Global IT recommended solutions to access Company Equipment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TzxcFJBdv2R6S+Lc0IWILYkkPzGJ4siidcftFszhlIs="},"b836f146-9d8c-40dc-9090-ca1584f490fd":{"id_":"b836f146-9d8c-40dc-9090-ca1584f490fd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"pk3BtN3OQEFvHaZRp9o6tGVB0nqtVGEQcb7uCIw2GYQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"862de0b0-2eff-4e71-a409-aeca8a72bd79","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"TzxcFJBdv2R6S+Lc0IWILYkkPzGJ4siidcftFszhlIs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a09e126e-f858-43b5-83c4-de88aab8aba9","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"TpdyXFMDFCKqrNIjxUaJ7VZIoOTFfktZfcOw44/k/MM="}},"text":"At this time Global IT only allows Kaseya’s “Remote Control” to access end user computers.

This policy applies to all Evidence Action employees. The purpose of this policy is to help ensure consistency in the use of Passwords and other authentication methods as the first line defense against unauthorized access to Evidence Action systems and data. # POLICY\n\nPasswords, Single Sign On (SSO), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are the key features of Evidence Action’s information and system security. They are the first line of protection for user accounts and organization data that may be accessed at any time from anywhere in the world. Access not secured with password and multifactor security, or configured to use SSO with Google accounts, may lead to the compromise of Evidence Action’s data, systems, proprietary information, and operational functionality. All systems must meet the following minimum organizational standards for access control:\n\n- A password length of 8 or more characters;\n- An annual password reset on the anniversary of last reset;\n- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) configured. If SSO configuration to Google Apps is available, access to systems should be configured accordingly. If SSO configuration to Google Apps is not possible, the minimum organizational standards above should be in effect. # DEFINITIONS\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication – An extra layer of security that requires not only a Password and username but also something that only an individual user has on them; most commonly a mobile phone number that will receive a unique text code to verify the identity of the individual attempting to gain access.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hsoOzQmppfR6YfbP9yCagf+RASYhB/BmTeHvJ9aemCA="},"f0183653-4d0e-4ec4-9e49-d6f0d9903766":{"id_":"f0183653-4d0e-4ec4-9e49-d6f0d9903766","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"pk3BtN3OQEFvHaZRp9o6tGVB0nqtVGEQcb7uCIw2GYQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bf1bb048-f1f1-467b-a79c-35849272a8ae","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"hsoOzQmppfR6YfbP9yCagf+RASYhB/BmTeHvJ9aemCA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"869786c7-db6a-4a9d-aafe-9202c6df912b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"MQMmDF7PG8gyEp44VctbVapOus9VGy8hQqs1JuyczAI="}},"text":"Password – A secret string of characters (or phrase) that must be used to gain admission to a computer, interface, or system. Password Management Software – An application that is used to store and manage the Passwords that a user has for various online accounts. Password Managers store the Passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the Password data with the help of a single master Password. One advantage of Password Managers is it enables the use of many highly complex (and difficult to remember) Passwords with the ease of a few clicks. Most Password Managers also assist in generating randomized complex passwords. Access Control – A security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. There are two main types of access control: physical and logical. Physical access control limits access to buildings, rooms and physical IT assets. Logical access control limits connections to computer networks, system files and data.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure there are recovery options in the event company data or systems suffer corruption, loss, or modification either as a result of a disaster or other incident. # POLICY\n\nEvidence Action’s systems play important functions and contain critical information, and the interruption of systems could have major consequences. The ability to recover operations in such an event is therefore paramount. The IT department will partner with system administrators and owners to understand their system’s backup and restoration options, and to perform periodic per-system assessments with an eye towards automation, cost efficiency, and suitability. All systems at Evidence Action should have recovery planning in place, either as a service by the providers or configured internally in conjunction with the IT Department. Systems should allow for the single instance or total recovery of lost or modified data for at least 14 days. Company data, files, version history, and a log of all changes to content should be recoverable for at least 14 days. Each system should keep a log of all actions taken by administrators for at least one year. This log should be protected from editing by Evidence Action employees. # DEFINITIONS\n\nBackup- An export or copy of data maintained separately from the production data in the system. Recovery- The act of restoring data from a backup or other source to the production system. Recovery Plan- A document containing the procedures, authority, and details of when and how data recovery will be authorized to take place.

The purpose of this policy is to define criteria for using and registering domain names and ensure the centralized management of domain names to maintain Evidence Action's identity. Importance of evidenceaction.org Domain Name\n\nHaving a website with evidenceaction.org domain name enhances the credibility and legitimacy of Evidence Action compared to relying solely on social media platforms or using another entity's domain. The evidenceaction.org domain name provides a distinct identity and reinforces Evidence Action's presence on the internet. # Scope of the Policy\n\nThis policy applies to all new domain names registered after the effective date of this policy. It applies to domain names only and does not apply to web contents and where websites are hosted. # POLICY\n\nDomain Name Registration\n\nEvidence Action requires all domain names to be registered through reputable domain registrars such as GoDaddy, Network Solutions, AWS, Microsoft, Google, etc. This ensures reliability and adherence to industry standards. As Evidence Action continues to grow, it is necessary to:\n\n- Centralize all domain names: All domain names associated with Evidence Action must be managed and controlled centrally to maintain consistent branding and control over web properties. - Establish Evidence Action's identity: Registering domain names under the evidenceaction.org domain consolidates Evidence Action's online presence and strengthens its brand recognition.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"p6eyfF6T+KYggcH39ilKPk83q6dJTLzVwd9VOGxa+QI="},"c6ae67e4-f832-458d-a7bb-e5ef34b87aaf":{"id_":"c6ae67e4-f832-458d-a7bb-e5ef34b87aaf","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"pk3BtN3OQEFvHaZRp9o6tGVB0nqtVGEQcb7uCIw2GYQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"55df0f62-ae06-4c5d-a472-252429f8b966","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"p6eyfF6T+KYggcH39ilKPk83q6dJTLzVwd9VOGxa+QI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3b112d90-c426-40e0-a3d7-f476eedacadd","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"yV/bR2Y5iQg2wuUX4H2WJCMGangje3khsAOGh0AcS8s="}},"text":"Domain name registration requirements\n\nIt is recommended that Evidence Action web applications, websites, and any web presence utilize the evidenceaction.org domain name wherever possible. This can be achieved by requesting a subdomain from Evidence Action's Global IT team. For instance, instead of registering a new domain name like 'apps.org,' use the domain name 'apps.evidenceaction.org. ' In this example, 'apps' is a subdomain of the primary domain name evidenceaction.org. This approach ensures consistency, reinforces Evidence Action's identity, and eliminates the costs associated with registering new domain names. Exceptions\n\nIn exceptional cases, there may arise situations where it is deemed necessary to register a new domain name. Such cases will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Page 17 of 19\n---\n# Evidence Action Global Information Technology Policies and Procedures Manual\n\n# DEFINITIONS\n\nDomain Name - an online web address used to uniquely identify a website. Each website has its own unique domain name. For Evidence Action, the official domain name is www.evidenceaction.org. # PROCEDURES\n\nTo register a new domain name, a request must be submitted to the Global IT team at helpdesk@evidenceaction.org. If an exception is requested, proper justification should be provided. If denied, the request will be escalated to the COO for further consideration. This process ensures careful consideration and maintains the centralized control of domain names. All new domain names must be registered by Global IT. By adhering to this Domain Name Registration Policy, Evidence Action ensures the centralized management of domain names, strengthens its online presence, and maintains consistency in branding across all web properties. # FURTHER INFORMATION\n\nFor additional information, please contact the IT Department. # HISTORY\n\nOrigin: 1 October 2023\n\nPage 18 of 19\n---\n# Appendix A.

Having a comprehensive plan in place ensures that we are equipped to take swift and appropriate actions when such situations arise. # Goals\n\n1. Safeguard pe confidentiality of employee data, and uphold pe integrity and accessibility of Evidence Action's systems, networks, and associated data. 2. Assist Evidence Action's staff in restoring peir operational workflows following a computer or network security breach or any form of data compromise. 3. Implement a coherent response strategy to combat system and network preats pat jeopardize Evidence Action's data and infrastructure. ---\n# Establish and execute a communication plan encompassing initial incident reporting and ongoing updates as required. # Handle legal matters pertaining to cybersecurity incidents. # Coordinate closely with external Computer Incident Response Teams and law enforcement agencies. # Mitigate potential damage to Evidence Action's reputation. # Guidelines\n\nThis plan offers actionable guidelines and standard operating procedures for addressing cybersecurity incidents and data breaches effectively. It outlines the formation of a team of initial responders to such incidents, delineating clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. While primarily tailored for cyber-related incidents and breaches, this plan can also be adapted for handling data breaches unrelated to computer systems. ---\n# Incident Response Team (IRT)\n\nOur Incident Response Team will comprise all members of the Global IT department, regional IT leads, as well as representatives from Operations, HR, and Communications.

Examples of how Evidence Action becomes aware of an incident include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Automated alerts triggered by intrusion detection systems or security monitoring tools. - Reports from employees or users who notice suspicious activities or anomalies. - Notifications from third-party vendors or partners. - Analysis of system logs or network traffic revealing unusual patterns or behaviors. - External reports or notifications from law enforcement agencies or regulatory bodies. - Results of routine security assessments or penetration tests uncovering vulnerabilities or weaknesses. - Notifications from customers or clients reporting unusual or unauthorized activities related to their interactions with Evidence Action systems or services. # Notification\n\nThis section outlines procedures for notifying the Incident Response Team (IRT) of any incident occurrence and maintaining communication throughout the incident. It includes establishing an escalation process. ---\ndetermining the initial point of contact, and identifying additional stakeholders who need to be informed in the event of a significant incident. Notification will primarily be conducted through the ticketing system via email, unless the email system is suspected to be compromised. In such cases, alternative communication systems outside of Evidence Action, such as WhatsApp, will be utilized. If notification needs to occur outside of office hours when recipients may not have access to email service, communication systems like WhatsApp will be employed. Anyone suspecting an incident will notify the IRT by completing the Incident Response Form. Depending on the severity of the incident, the CSIRT coordinator will notify the CSIRT Lead and/or the White/Green Team accordingly. Containment:\n\nContainment efforts will focus on minimizing financial losses, safeguarding reputation, preventing service disruptions, and limiting the potential spread of infection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2T95WC6uPg/k+LI3yIFm7t3VFvwis8M3C+axlR25r8M="},"697262ed-97b4-4db1-b365-3a8d3ad9eba6":{"id_":"697262ed-97b4-4db1-b365-3a8d3ad9eba6","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"hash":"l/th6ix6xA7yd9hngZBxPy1pmIPer3Oiyjd3jf0BDoA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6c7d8cf6-9b96-462d-a619-5e334208c31d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"hash":"2T95WC6uPg/k+LI3yIFm7t3VFvwis8M3C+axlR25r8M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fea3aae1-cc43-492f-b8b8-9850028b937b","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf","file_name":"Cybersecurity Incidence Response Plan.pdf"},"hash":"3tWxwYOnkDSy86qBT4KQ3gx7jsLJTiW7yOXzVFS4uks="}},"text":"Initial communication with both internal and external stakeholders will be conducted as necessary.

Evidence Action permits staff to experiment with AI tools in their work. In doing so, you are encouraged to iterate, again, with the use of AI while understanding that formal approval is needed to institutionalize an AI tool into a system or process. # Guidelines for use\n\n|1. Humans make decisions and we will remain human-centered in our use of AI.|a. While AI tools might assist us in the analysis of data, creation of content, or performance of tasks, humans–rather than AI tools–will make decisions.|\n|---|---|\n| |b. We view AI tools as means to amplify and augment human abilities and as another avenue to challenge convention in pursuit of our mission.|\n|2. Everyone is accountable for their work products.|a. If you use AI tools in your work, you are still responsible for the final product and any errors therein.|\n| |b. Use due care in evaluating products created with the assistance of AI tools.|\n|3. Be transparent in your use of AI for work.|a. As appropriate, acknowledge when and how you use AI tools in your work. Specific requirements for acknowledgment will be left to supervisors to establish based on the nature of the work, the significance of the contributions of specific AI tools, and our existing policies (more on these below).|\n| |b. You are encouraged to share promising applications of (or concerns about) AI tools with your colleagues, for example via the #EvAcGPT Slack channel.|\n|4. As Evidence Action employees, we all have a responsibility to protect Evidence Action’s confidential and proprietary information, including organizational intellectual property.|a. Different AI tools use your inputs differently and might expose information you input and/or use it to generate results for other users.|\n---\nb. So, do not input confidential, internal, financial, personally identifiable, or proprietary (e.g., trademarks, unique programmatic practices, etc. ) information into public models. c.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GFfLtntHBGIor/+sf1RYBrYiMv/bYi6n2yYQ4JwuXxI="},"61bcfe78-fffe-41e7-a95f-b00e414c2890":{"id_":"61bcfe78-fffe-41e7-a95f-b00e414c2890","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"EuYfFe65HtFFhsa6MO8IqEUr6b5mbDrICmM37glG+dM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"443c060c-8e02-4c27-8f6d-c2ec7cbbb6ac","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"GFfLtntHBGIor/+sf1RYBrYiMv/bYi6n2yYQ4JwuXxI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d320a36c-43e8-4b20-996d-9fdaa1c4cf21","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"czza3gd9CmWrwHy3Cvk54EmJQuMtnsscP0JZsDy6jgM="}},"text":") information into public models. c. This includes Evidence Action’s intellectual property - e.g., images, trademarks, brands, etc. - given how some AI tools use (and reuse) these sorts of IP assets. d. Consult our IT Team for guidance on what tools might be appropriate for use with confidential or proprietary information or data. # Risks of use\n\nBe knowledgeable and informed about the risks and limitations of generative AI tools. While these will continue to evolve, some risks to consider are:\n\n|1.|Generative AI tools regularly “hallucinate,” providing false but plausible and correct-seeming information. This information can seem persuasive but could be entirely fabricated or inaccurate.|\n|---|---|\n|2.|AI tools may amplify biases via their output because they are trained on data sets derived from the internet, and their data may include overrepresented, racist, misogynistic, and other biased views.|\n|3.|Using generative AI tools might create reputational risks for the organization when it produces work containing inaccurate information or for purposes that people might consider disingenuous or offensive (e.g. to write a “heartfelt message”).|\n|4.|There are risks and debates around ethical storytelling and AI. For example, AI-generated but realistic images might be used to evoke sympathy, without representing real images or people.|\n|5.|There are risks and debates around intellectual property and how generative AI tools have incorporated the text and work of creators without compensation.|\n\n# Preliminary Governance of Adoption\n\n1. While the above guidelines and risks are not comprehensive, they are intended to provide practical guidance on our use of AI tools, which will evolve. Some tools, such as proofreading plug-ins (e.g. Grammarly) or fundraising tools are already in regular use and include AI-powered features; these guidelines are not meant to prevent their use. As noted above, consult your supervisor and our IT team for guidance around specific applications of AI tools. We will need to iterate, again together as we seek to responsibly adopt these technologies in furtherance of our mission. 2. These principles supplement and support rather than supplant the existing policies, regulations, and laws we already follow regarding the safeguarding of data, the use of digital tools, and how we communicate and attribute (most directly our Information Management, Confidentiality, IT Acceptable Use, and Communications policies and Privacy Statement). 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cHnPchLjTpPrnm97X2Nu1rYoztj58rhvR6t55Sh6kss="},"d320a36c-43e8-4b20-996d-9fdaa1c4cf21":{"id_":"d320a36c-43e8-4b20-996d-9fdaa1c4cf21","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"EuYfFe65HtFFhsa6MO8IqEUr6b5mbDrICmM37glG+dM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"61bcfe78-fffe-41e7-a95f-b00e414c2890","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action AI Guidelines .pdf"},"hash":"cHnPchLjTpPrnm97X2Nu1rYoztj58rhvR6t55Sh6kss="}},"text":"3.

Where Evidence Action has implemented a country-specific Child Protection Policy, the country lead is responsible for ensuring all participants are made aware of and follow the applicable country-specific policy. Evidence Action management staff, interns and volunteers as well as consultants, partners, sub-contractors and independent contractors who come into contact with children as a result of their work for or with Evidence Action, must:\n\n- Be made aware of this policy, and receive training as appropriate. - Take any action or refrain from acting in a way that would put a child at risk of potential Child Abuse, by that person or others. - Report any Child Abuse concerns. This is a mandatory requirement and failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. All reports must be submitted in the manner described below. There may also be legal obligations to report suspected or actual Child Abuse to law enforcement or other governmental authorities.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"N++86NqoULncz/6ZPxyJGSqwjANUFHQP3fcmt+SBpsc="},"4c73ad9a-b67d-4bdb-958a-926fdf182186":{"id_":"4c73ad9a-b67d-4bdb-958a-926fdf182186","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"hash":"9kqsBX5r8WPwv4zmCGyfzHDyRWvngKCHESRKze+tWV8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"08a28e77-c945-41ff-92a6-301332a66cce","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"hash":"N++86NqoULncz/6ZPxyJGSqwjANUFHQP3fcmt+SBpsc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"19995023-b78b-465d-bff9-68fe27279f1e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf","file_name":"Evidence Action Global Child Protection Policy10232019 clean.docx.pdf"},"hash":"+YXRlQNx9miyylEaqIKJlwfWfhasTS8YsSMReMPwg4o="}},"text":"---\nRespond to a child who may have been abused or exploited in accordance with applicable local office procedures including reporting to law enforcement authorities as applicable. Cooperate honestly, fully and confidentially in any investigation of concerns or allegations of Child Abuse. Contribute to an environment where children are respected and encouraged to discuss their concerns and rights in an honest and confidential manner. Always ask permission from children (or their parents/guardian for young children) before taking images (e.g., photograph, video) of them. Respect their decision to say no to having an image taken. Ensure that any images taken of children are respectful (e.g., children should be appropriately clothed and images taken should not be sexually suggestive or in any way impact negatively on their dignity or privacy). Stories and images of children should be based on the child’s best interest. Be aware that where concerns exist about the conduct of staff, consultants, independent contractors, sub-contractors or others in relation to child protection and/or where there has been a breach of this Global Child Protection Policy, Evidence Action will undertake an investigation in accordance with this Global Child Protection Policy or if required by applicable law. This may result in disciplinary sanctions and/or dismissal of staff. Be aware that Evidence Action will sever all relations with any Evidence Action partner, sub-contractor, independent contractor or others who are proven to have committed Child Abuse. No child is to be employed in any of the office premises of Evidence Action nor is Evidence Action to deal/trade with vendors or suppliers which employ a child for any purpose or in any manner. Be aware that if legitimate concerns about suspected Child Abuse are raised which proves to be unfounded upon investigation, no action will be taken against the reporter. However, any employee who makes false and malicious accusation could face disciplinary action, including possible dismissal. Be aware that Evidence Action may take appropriate legal or other action against Evidence Action management staff, interns and volunteers as well as consultants, partners, sub-contractors and independent contractors or others who make false accusations of Child Abuse. All senior leadership including regional and country leads must ensure that each Evidence Action office has implemented this Global Child Protection Policy or has implemented a consistent, country-specific policy.

This policy should be applied along with the Supplemental Procedures for U.S. Staff Travel (FIN.US.EXT.01) and Supplemental Policies and Procedures for Africa Region Staff Travel (FIN.AR.EXT.01). This policy applies to all Evidence Action Staff who undertake travel for business purposes. # POLICY\n\nBusiness travel and the expenses associated with it will be authorized only in circumstances which are clearly consistent with the mission of the organization. It will be the responsibility of each Supervisor to ensure that their staff member’s travel meets this objective. All travel should be arranged consistent with Evidence Action’s principles of cost-effectiveness and value for money. Allowable expenses include and are not limited to the following: economy class air, train, and bus fare; business-class or first-class train and bus fare in the Africa region; rental car fees; the cost of lodging; the cost of meals; the cost to obtain an appropriate visa(s) for international travel; taxis to and from place of entry and exit (e.g. airports, train stations); taxis to and from business meetings, business dinners, approved company functions; internet usage at airports, in flight, and hotels; international transaction fees incurred for business expenses; laundry or dry cleaning expenses for trips more than five consecutive nights; overweight and/or over-limit (up to two) baggage is allowed if the overage is due to business equipment required for business; travel immunizations and disease-prevention or treatment supplies; seat selection fees where appropriate; M&IE for business travel as provided in local policies.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dPYeicMtJA0o4Vl6Q/Lzw2RWX2A51E7bmRBRLby7tEY="},"a6e8fde3-47f6-4da6-b882-a92fc291be9c":{"id_":"a6e8fde3-47f6-4da6-b882-a92fc291be9c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"bTwb+NSXi2T6oGq5KS4ZbjfQbquVx2itTPUwnBmHMRs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"038808ec-4e3b-4fdc-9870-71ccaa7ed300","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"dPYeicMtJA0o4Vl6Q/Lzw2RWX2A51E7bmRBRLby7tEY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ac5c21ac-17fb-4753-9c6c-e08f96a3c136","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"PKYaZBb7+HOEBlVONgnFtYiObTRqf/DUxyxok0LXQKU="}},"text":"Non-allowable expenses include and are not limited to the following: airfare or transportation to or expenses in any venue other than the place of business for personal time; business-class or first-class air fare; costs incurred for travel or transportation of family members; laundry or dry cleaning expenses for trips less than five consecutive nights; charitable contributions to local organizations; transport to and from personal meals; recreational activities or personal entertainment; international transaction fees incurred for personal expenses; lost luggage and contents; and passport renewal fees. Staff may add and pay for a personal leg to a business itinerary, while clearly distinguishing between business and personal expenses. If a combined business/personal itinerary is equal to or less than the cost of a business-only airfare, there is no cost to the Staff member. If a combined business/personal itinerary is greater than the cost of a business-only airfare, only the business portion of the ticket will be reimbursed. In general, Evidence Action does not support a substitution or exchange philosophy with regard to travel expenditures. If a Staff member chooses a less expensive option, it would not be appropriate to utilize this “cost savings” somewhere else. All expenses for reimbursement must have a substantiated, business purpose. # Maximum Daily Allowance\n---\nStaff on international travel (i.e., travel outside the country of their Duty Station) and travel within the U.S. for valid and approved business purposes will be reimbursed for the actual cost of eligible expenses up to the maximum daily allowance amount. Meals and incidentals and the cost of lodging and accommodations are eligible for reimbursement with receipts. The maximum daily allowance for the actual cost of meals and incidentals is $50 for international travel and travel within the U.S. This rate includes the cost of breakfast, lunch, dinner and incidental expenses. Maximum daily allowance are permissible for a layover where a night of lodging is necessary for Staff to arrive at their final destinations ready to perform for the start of the work day. It is acknowledged that in some circumstances, it may be unavoidable to exceed these rates. It is at the Supervisor’s discretion, in conjunction with the Controller, to approve higher amounts within reason provided appropriate justification or documentation. For example, an email request approved by the Supervisor and Controller about a particular travel destination being relatively expensive is sufficient. This email exchange should then be subsequently attached to the expense report when the expense is submitted.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nGfb+9a0UN1830RD0u+Jpdv49Uzdxg0FFO+TWr8Q1F8="},"ac5c21ac-17fb-4753-9c6c-e08f96a3c136":{"id_":"ac5c21ac-17fb-4753-9c6c-e08f96a3c136","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"bTwb+NSXi2T6oGq5KS4ZbjfQbquVx2itTPUwnBmHMRs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a6e8fde3-47f6-4da6-b882-a92fc291be9c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"nGfb+9a0UN1830RD0u+Jpdv49Uzdxg0FFO+TWr8Q1F8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e1dfacbc-9432-4a98-bd24-a8fad4f67112","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"74wbei/O3iAMZ6OufjYbQDDRP/TW+6Yhz40FcLg4qbw="}},"text":"This email exchange should then be subsequently attached to the expense report when the expense is submitted.

These procedures should be applied along with the Global Travel Policy (FIN.G.EXT.01). # POLICY\n\nM&IE\n\nEvidence Action Africa Region will provide M&IE to staff according to the following conditions. The M&IE is a fixed amount paid in lieu of actual meals and incidental expenses and is also based on the location of staff members at the time expenses are incurred. Actual receipts are not required to claim M&IE. M&IE is intended to substantially cover the cost of meals and incidental travel expenses, but eligibility restrictions do apply. The M&IE rate is made up of Lunch 40%, Dinner 40%, and Incidental Expenses 20%. An exception applies in Kenya, where staff are eligible to claim the M&IE rate plus one receipted meal. Transport and Lodging & Accommodations are separate from M&IE. If breakfast is not included in lodging, breakfast can be claimed at 30% of the M&IE rate, by providing a receipt. On both the first and last day of the business trip, the rate will be based on 100% of the daily M&IE rate. For early morning or late evening travel, staff will be entitled to breakfast at a maximum rate of 30% or dinner at a maximum rate of 45% of the applicable daily M&IE rate. Receipts are required to claim this. For residential full board trainings and conferences, M&IE will be paid at 20% of M&IE rate, which is the incidental expenses portion only. If meals are provided to you during your trip, you may not claim the M&IE rate for the meal provided for that day. This is important in reconciling your travel advance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AkSxA7hAZ6ZULLUwdhuC2prrYik3/qPHsUlvk12ui4w="},"92f9677d-957e-4e9f-a391-57545914b8df":{"id_":"92f9677d-957e-4e9f-a391-57545914b8df","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"bTwb+NSXi2T6oGq5KS4ZbjfQbquVx2itTPUwnBmHMRs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6bbc1bb7-95c7-4bee-8bce-22024ea7ce44","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"AkSxA7hAZ6ZULLUwdhuC2prrYik3/qPHsUlvk12ui4w="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c5fbd6f9-6dc6-45c3-8666-827f04cc29e5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"LTj2gjD/0WAcQbNPxGQmawfwJqNOhz2GuLMn7sGWMkc="}},"text":"This is important in reconciling your travel advance.

The Cardholder will obtain and retain receipts for all expenses in accordance with the policy and limits contained in the Travel Policy for expense reimbursements. Receipts should be from the supplier showing the items paid for and the cost. The Cardholder will receive a monthly statement detailing purchases made in the previous month. These statements must be submitted to the Cardholder's supervisor for approval in Intacct with appropriate coding, receipts, and proper descriptions by the 6th day of the following month. Failure to submit completed credit card statements with all required coding and documentation by the deadline three times will cause a temporary suspension of that card until statements are submitted. Credit card expense statements which are not received by the deadline may delay the issuance of monthly reports or result in incomplete or inaccurate monthly reports being shared with programs and donors. A Corporate Credit Card can be cancelled at any time at the discretion of the CFO in cases where a Cardholder regularly misuses the card (including using it for personal expenses or for expenses that are not within the policy or for approved purposes), or regularly submits reports beyond the deadline. Any expense exceeding $2,000 must be pre-approved by email by the Cardholder's supervisor, with the exception of flights approved separately under the Travel Policy (FIN.G.EXT.01). Documentation of these approvals must be submitted along with the receipts. Cards will have a $7,500 limit unless otherwise agreed upon with and approved by the CFO. Cardholders are responsible for reimbursing any charges that are not pre-approved. Under the circumstance that a receipt for purchases above $25 cannot be obtained, Cardholders are responsible for completing a Missing Receipt Declaration. In the event that the Cardholder inadvertently uses the corporate card for a personal expense, the Cardholder must promptly notify his/her supervisor and the CFO and immediately reimburse Evidence Action. Reimbursement to Evidence Action should be made no later than the 15th of the following month. ---\nor within 30 days (whichever is sooner) or can be deducted directly through payroll from the Cardholder's next paycheck if preferred.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"V/NbvyxKXWgEM9nER3boi4pyayWxcDAeIc5r49SEMVM="},"5221ca8a-e8fc-4e89-9862-b554d9d57ecb":{"id_":"5221ca8a-e8fc-4e89-9862-b554d9d57ecb","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"bTwb+NSXi2T6oGq5KS4ZbjfQbquVx2itTPUwnBmHMRs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"be6b2880-ee16-43f5-b34b-63b2622f5c44","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"V/NbvyxKXWgEM9nER3boi4pyayWxcDAeIc5r49SEMVM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e97bfb8a-81cf-4b25-83bf-be4b87ffc8ef","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf","file_name":"Global Finance Manual for Staff.pdf"},"hash":"4AoBgQ/dcdv4z2NaLH0+12wjvlUBN1hWK/xFXsz6Arc="}},"text":"For temporary cards, the intended use and duration of the card will be outlined and approved by the Director, Global Finance and Accounting in advance of the card’s issuance.

Use of Evidence Action systems constitutes consent to these guidelines and an understanding that possible disciplinary action may occur if misuse or abuse of these systems is discovered. # POLICY\n\nBackground\n\nEvidence Action makes use of a variety of data to create information relating to its operations and programs. Evidence Action collects and stores information of many types in a variety of formats. The relative importance and sensitivity of this information varies and is subject to Evidence Action’s Information Classification procedure. ---\nIn collecting and using this information, Evidence Action is subject to legislation, regulations, and funder/partner rules controlling how this information can be handled and the safeguards that must be put in place to protect it. Evidence Action also believes in the inherent value of safeguarding information and therefore abides by additional best practice even when not legally or contractually required to do so. Sensitive organizational information must be protected from loss of integrity, confidentiality, or availability. The risks of inadequate access controls range from inconvenience to critical loss or corruption of information. It is important that Evidence Action information is – as far as it can be protected from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorized access, and unauthorized release. A range of controls are used to ensure information security including backups, identity management, and encryption. # 2.1 Principles of Information Management\n\nThere are a number of key principles that must be adopted when creating a compliant information management environment. These principles apply regardless of format or medium. All information will be:\n\n- Collected for a specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose;\n- Relevant and limited to what is necessary;\n- Accurate and remain up to date (except where older/archive information is necessary for historical purposes);\n- Classified according to the Evidence Action Information Classification procedure;\n- Retained in a form which allows identification for disposition;\n- Stored and shared in compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements;\n- Shared only with approved/authorized parties;\n- Secure during the entire life-cycle; and\n- Destroyed in accordance with an approved schedule. All users will be aware of good information management practices and will receive training as required for their position. If in doubt, staff should consult Global Operations. # Roles of Content Owner and Content Manager\n\nContent Owner and Content Managers serve in key roles as designated custodians for managing a group of information and ensuring compliance with this policy.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NoBLBoDFPTgs6ZpJjNJT04GkDKYuNMypeHsi1YE3sh0="},"93abd93f-6ba7-4c7d-9df3-7198d0e7e83e":{"id_":"93abd93f-6ba7-4c7d-9df3-7198d0e7e83e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"NfZfQoJlpRI52xWX5fZ8JcRZhuZE9Fcf97DutRZNgqc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6fb814c7-661a-44f8-bb60-2d8713f2db85","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"NoBLBoDFPTgs6ZpJjNJT04GkDKYuNMypeHsi1YE3sh0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0b24eeec-47ff-426b-8beb-85f0573dafbc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"JF/VGl8ZgCC12V9fcb0ndhg17vQQ/H+UjNGEY6cptbQ="}},"text":"Content Owners (CO) are ultimately responsible for ensuring teams’ compliance with the IM Policy and empowering their Content Manager(s) to effectively implement the IM Policy.

Global IT maintains a list of approved applications; for more information, please contact Global IT. Box is Evidence Action’s designated primary file storage system. As such, it is preferred that staff use Box to both create and store information. If you are storing personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information, it MUST be stored in Box. Use Box:\n\n- For storage of all final versions of documents\n- To create a single, coherent location for organizing related-documents (i.e. project files, even if they contain bookmarks to other storage locations)\n- To bookmark key files stored in other locations/systems (i.e. Google Drive)\n- When creating and storing Confidential information (MANDATORY)\n- For collaborating or sharing information with external parties\n\nUse Google Drive\n\n- For collaboration on and drafting of non-confidential documents\n\nWhen collecting data and information, employees should use company-approved data collection and analysis tools as required by employee responsibilities. These may include, but are not limited to, the following: R, ODK, Stata, ArcGIS, etc. # Information Classification\n\nAll information can be classified according to the below stated Classification Schema which is used to guide Access Control. This policy applies to information in all formats or media. Information assets are classified according to the risks associated with information being stored or processed.

The purpose of these information classification categories is to guide employees’ routine interaction with Evidence Action information. These guidelines apply to all types of information Evidence Action uses globally. If there are questions regarding the proper handling and use of information, an employee should direct questions to Global Operations. Information Classifications\n\nCompany information can generally be categorized in three ways; employees should assess the information they interact with and handle it in accordance with the respective security control guidelines. 1. Public: Information explicitly or implicitly approved for distribution to the public without restriction. It can be freely distributed without potential harm to Evidence Action, donors, affiliates, or individuals. Public information generally has a very low sensitivity since by definition there is no such thing as unauthorized disclosure, but it still\n---\n# II. Internal\n\nInformation intended for internal business use only with access restricted to a specific workgroup, department, group of individuals, or affiliates with a legitimate need. Internal information is generally not made available to parties outside of Evidence Action. Unauthorized disclosure could adversely impact the company, donors, affiliates, or individuals. Internal data generally have a low to moderate sensitivity. Examples include: financial accounting data not containing confidential information; company intranet; programmatic data that doesn't contain PII; company strategic plans; HR, IT, or other company policy documents. # III. Confidential\n\nHighly sensitive information intended for limited, specific use by a workgroup, department, or group of individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. Explicit authorization from the Content Owner is required for access because of legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints. Unauthorized disclosure or transfer of information could have a serious adverse impact on the core business functions of the company or its affiliates, the personal privacy of individuals, or on compliance with federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations.

All files and other electronic documents related to Evidence Action business are to be stored in the appropriate location within Box. In limited cases, if a file cannot be stored on Box, a bookmark should be put in Box to direct users to the file location (i.e. Google Drive). A key advantage of Box is visibility and long-term continuity. Because Box is centrally managed and owned, files are more easily found by employees. When an employee departs Evidence Action, their files remain in Box for future discoverability. Evidence Action’s secondary file collaboration system is Google Drive. Google Drive may be used for documents that are actively being edited, reviewed, and collaborated upon. All final versions of documents in Google Drive should be stored in Box for long-term retention; draft or active documents should be bookmarked in Box for easier accessibility. Accounts for other cloud-based storage systems (such as Dropbox, OneDrive) are not supported, and any Evidence Action-related files should not be stored on these non-authorized systems. ---\nIf necessary to ensure compliance with in-country regulations, a separate or additional local storage system may be adopted with approval from Global Operations to store sensitive information (e.g. raw data with personal identifiers, etc.).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hYXVHMkbndTJruffanHtmBiC+gaaUGuI3KGAOAxSrms="},"3eb7f90b-d3bb-43d6-9b1f-b52688e9368d":{"id_":"3eb7f90b-d3bb-43d6-9b1f-b52688e9368d","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"NfZfQoJlpRI52xWX5fZ8JcRZhuZE9Fcf97DutRZNgqc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"44a30140-8b2a-4c95-9308-1357ed16885c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"hYXVHMkbndTJruffanHtmBiC+gaaUGuI3KGAOAxSrms="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"be4825c1-3874-482a-9df7-7680980e0d64","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf","file_name":"Information Management Policy FINAL 20230201.pdf"},"hash":"kmhjXssfGeWS+Zk3D8oC73FYJILkm+lC/O1Up1sALGM="}},"text":"raw data with personal identifiers, etc.).

All Company Equipment must have up-to-date Antivirus, Antimalware, Endpoint Security and Management Software installed and actively protected. This is the responsibility of the IT department. ---\n# Evidence Action Global Information Technology Policies and Procedures Manual\n\nThe use of personal devices is allowed at Evidence Action subject to the guidelines found in the Bring Your Own Device Policy (IT.GL.06). Procurement of equipment such as laptops, monitors, printers, and computers will be as standardized as possible to ensure consistency with the brand and model of equipment used at Evidence Action. The IT department will provide guidance on the specifications, brand, model, and pricing of equipment to be procured. While availability of equipment can vary by locality, all attempts should be made to conform as closely as possible to the recommended equipment. When purchasing equipment such as laptops, it is strongly advised to secure a warranty of 3 years or more to match the anticipated useful life span of the equipment. All laptops, computers, tablets, smartphones, printers and other equipment should be recorded and tracked in an equipment/asset inventory. This is the responsibility of the IT department with support from administrative staff in some regions. Pertinent equipment data that is captured should include manufacturer, model, serial numbers, purchase data, system hardware configuration, software configuration, operating system, general specs, warranty information, employee assignment, physical office location, and any other relevant notes regarding purchase date, access or usage. All laptops, computers, tablets or smartphones procured by Evidence Action must have an asset tag affixed. This is the responsibility of the IT department with support from administrative staff in some regions. The asset tag’s unique number should be recorded in the centralized equipment/asset inventory. No individual should access Company Equipment without prior approval from the employee, and will only use Global IT recommended solutions to access Company Equipment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TzxcFJBdv2R6S+Lc0IWILYkkPzGJ4siidcftFszhlIs="},"44d02037-331f-41cf-86fa-ad2c2094ca1c":{"id_":"44d02037-331f-41cf-86fa-ad2c2094ca1c","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"94MoPt2Lw7wGSw2/WiwAzvhVRMFDlbi1lK9GaSqcWPA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f0b00f63-e8e8-43d5-8aab-400b4f89d46e","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"TzxcFJBdv2R6S+Lc0IWILYkkPzGJ4siidcftFszhlIs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"854a61b4-c4cb-45e4-9ed3-97d8a946b085","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"wVZDzO/+7lg5UaRlpK7l21Iv56VpmNvR2fEAa6zsG+I="}},"text":"At this time Global IT only allows Kaseya’s “Remote Control” to access end user computers.

They are the first line of protection for user accounts and organization data that may be accessed at any time from anywhere in the world. Access not secured with password and multifactor security, or configured to use SSO with Google accounts, may lead to the compromise of Evidence Action’s data, systems, proprietary information, and operational functionality. All systems must meet the following minimum organizational standards for access control:\n\n- A password length of 8 or more characters;\n- An annual password reset on the anniversary of last reset;\n- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) configured. If SSO configuration to Google Apps is available, access to systems should be configured accordingly. If SSO configuration to Google Apps is not possible, the minimum organizational standards above should be in effect. # DEFINITIONS\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication – An extra layer of security that requires not only a Password and username but also something that only an individual user has on them; most commonly a mobile phone number that will receive a unique text code to verify the identity of the individual attempting to gain access.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hsoOzQmppfR6YfbP9yCagf+RASYhB/BmTeHvJ9aemCA="},"6b50bbcc-a6fb-4d95-bc6c-df03e1d8c692":{"id_":"6b50bbcc-a6fb-4d95-bc6c-df03e1d8c692","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Policy 10-2023.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"94MoPt2Lw7wGSw2/WiwAzvhVRMFDlbi1lK9GaSqcWPA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1b4dd5fc-2f43-4d80-af77-170cbe115fbc","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"hsoOzQmppfR6YfbP9yCagf+RASYhB/BmTeHvJ9aemCA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b2d4f206-9e4d-4d3c-92e2-87f44d667d5a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Policy 10-2023.pdf","file_name":"IT Policy 10-2023.pdf"},"hash":"AWnyrFcKCp1COnWFpeY1/A8zi69s8vTzvbFTpA+50Gs="}},"text":"Password – A secret string of characters (or phrase) that must be used to gain admission to a computer, interface, or system. Password Management Software – An application that is used to store and manage the Passwords that a user has for various online accounts. Password Managers store the Passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the Password data with the help of a single master Password. One advantage of Password Managers is it enables the use of many highly complex (and difficult to remember) Passwords with the ease of a few clicks. Most Password Managers also assist in generating randomized complex passwords. Access Control – A security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. There are two main types of access control: physical and logical. Physical access control limits access to buildings, rooms and physical IT assets. Logical access control limits connections to computer networks, system files and data.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure there are recovery options in the event company data or systems suffer corruption, loss, or modification either as a result of a disaster or other incident. # POLICY\n\nEvidence Action’s systems play important functions and contain critical information, and the interruption of systems could have major consequences. The ability to recover operations in such an event is therefore paramount. The IT department will partner with system administrators and owners to understand their system’s backup and restoration options, and to perform periodic per-system assessments with an eye towards automation, cost efficiency, and suitability. All systems at Evidence Action should have recovery planning in place, either as a service by the providers or configured internally in conjunction with the IT Department. Systems should allow for the single instance or total recovery of lost or modified data for at least 14 days. Company data, files, version history, and a log of all changes to content should be recoverable for at least 14 days. Each system should keep a log of all actions taken by administrators for at least one year. This log should be protected from editing by Evidence Action employees. # DEFINITIONS\n\nBackup- An export or copy of data maintained separately from the production data in the system. Recovery- The act of restoring data from a backup or other source to the production system. Recovery Plan- A document containing the procedures, authority, and details of when and how data recovery will be authorized to take place. Continuity- The ability to continue operating during an incident requiring data recovery with minimal downtime for users. Supported by a recovery plan. Log- A journal automatically kept by systems of certain types of actions.

For instance, systems housing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without IT admin access, lacking Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2-FA), are vulnerable to compromise and data breaches. To address these concerns, IT Governance serves as a health check for critical systems, involving a structured assessment where IT poses carefully crafted questions to system owners. These questions cover aspects such as access control, business continuity, risk management, sysadmin roles, and cybersecurity. Each query is assigned a weight, and upon completion, IT furnishes a comprehensive report card to system owners. Using the scoring system, IT collaborates with system owners to develop a compliance roadmap, ensuring alignment with organizational standards and mitigating potential risks. IT risk management services IT risk management at Evidence Action is a vital service delivered by the IT team, aimed at evaluating the risks associated with mission-critical systems. The primary objective is to identify potential risks and propose effective mitigation strategies to ensure uninterrupted business operations. Each regional IT team is tasked with assessing the risks related to mission-critical systems specific to their respective regions. These region-specific risk assessments are then integrated into the overall organizational risk assessment framework. This integration not only offers a comprehensive view of the organization's risk landscape but also enhances transparency and instills confidence in the management team's decision-making process. System integration services IT offers system integration services tailored to specific needs, spanning from consultation to hands-on implementation, depending on available resources and the complexity of requests. These services encompass a broad spectrum of activities, including system consolidation and configuration, integration of both physical and cloud infrastructure, implementation of Single Sign-On across various systems, and the integration of communication systems and Artificial Intelligence, among others. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive, highlighting the diverse range of integration capabilities IT provides to enhance organizational efficiency and effectiveness. ---\nCybersecurity services\n\nEvidence Action’s cybersecurity program employs a three-pronged approach. Firstly, we prioritize enhancing our cybersecurity posture by adhering to the NIST cybersecurity framework, renowned for its effectiveness in safeguarding organizations against cyber threats. Secondly, we ensure continuous monitoring of all endpoints and critical infrastructures through an external Security Operations Center (SOC).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OZbXGEF4C4IS9p2FDzaWAB4atWrDqKPvMW3vacWqcUA="},"886df0f5-501d-4b9b-b2b7-a40e79cebea5":{"id_":"886df0f5-501d-4b9b-b2b7-a40e79cebea5","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Services Catalog v2.pdf","file_name":"IT Services Catalog v2.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/IT Services Catalog v2.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Services Catalog v2.pdf","file_name":"IT Services Catalog v2.pdf"},"hash":"eUXMPqgNb4mGJb2Rj4AZs8cjlOkVSPcic1LVDeL+bhk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"47f382e1-f769-4f6d-9227-cb23bc86da8a","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Services Catalog v2.pdf","file_name":"IT Services Catalog v2.pdf"},"hash":"OZbXGEF4C4IS9p2FDzaWAB4atWrDqKPvMW3vacWqcUA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f1ba8f9e-15cf-4e57-b0ef-a2842d796ee8","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\IT Services Catalog v2.pdf","file_name":"IT Services Catalog v2.pdf"},"hash":"80TEdeiCQ938Mk7Guo9erTBEtKt4gFthiRnjFn5nhjg="}},"text":"Lastly, we invest in a cybersecurity awareness program for our staff members, offering cybersecurity training and conducting regular phishing campaigns to assess and improve their skills in identifying potential threats.

It is essential to practice honesty and integrity and comply with all Evidence Action policies, as well as applicable laws and regulations. This Whistleblower Policy aims to encourage and enable employees and others to raise serious concerns and report potential violations. The goal is for Evidence Action to take corrective actions for inappropriate conduct. It is the responsibility of all individuals associated with Evidence Action to report concerns about violations of the Global Code of Conduct or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or policies governing Evidence Action’s operations. Examples of illegal or dishonest activities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Violations of federal, state, national, or local laws\n- Fraud and/or misappropriation of funds\n- Bribery, corruption, and kickbacks\n- Breaches of the Code of Conduct, such as sexual harassment, discrimination, bullying, and harassment\n- Fraudulent financial reporting\n\nEvidence Action operates an open-door policy and encourages employees to share concerns or complaints regarding serious violations. The preferred order for reporting is as follows, with the understanding that there may be circumstances where a report needs to be escalated to a higher level immediately:\n\n1. Direct supervisor\n2. Local Human Resources Representative\n3. Country lead\n4. Regional Human Resources office\n5. Member of the Global Leadership Team\n6. Chief People Officer\n---\nIf employees prefer to report the matter anonymously or without first reporting to anyone above, they can do so through Evidence Action’s confidential EthicsPoint platform, managed by an external service provider, NAVEX Global Inc. EthicsPoint is monitored by the service provider and matters are reported to the Chief People Officer for review and investigation. Where the matter relates to the Chief People Officer, the matter is reported to the CFAO.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IJ2/NE/acSTeZedXOYopv1YSfgSuGCrWSNpc0B/DnTQ="},"1921a672-d906-41ec-98d1-cc735b52f3b1":{"id_":"1921a672-d906-41ec-98d1-cc735b52f3b1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"hash":"FfrjktVfPvyzaQ+K7pqLUFTiuB0i8K7FdPFc+AoGKaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"628cbc0d-c305-4c33-8ac3-921eff3c1a44","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"hash":"IJ2/NE/acSTeZedXOYopv1YSfgSuGCrWSNpc0B/DnTQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e48dade1-956c-41f2-9b7e-e18650fdd817","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"hash":"aloZUQU3eVvPwtLBgEfIazcHGMMPGPJZL3ZyT/NMPp0="}},"text":"Where the matter relates to the Chief People Officer, the matter is reported to the CFAO.

If the local Human Resources representative is believed to be involved in the matter, then supervisors are directed to contact the Chief People Officer, who will coordinate an investigation and manage any potential corrective actions. When a concern and/or potential serious violation is reported, Evidence Action will evaluate the information received and decide on the appropriate next steps, including conducting an investigation where warranted. The investigation will be confidential and a reporter’s request for anonymity will be respected. Except when specifically authorized by the Chief People Officer, the complainant may neither investigate independently nor resolve any alleged misconduct or potential serious violation of company policy. Handling of Reported Violations\n\nEvidence Action’s Chief People Officer receives the report from the supervisor, local HR or EthicsPoint and will promptly review the information provided. Based on the review, the Chief People Officer will determine the type of complaint, if local laws apply and if the complaint needs to be addressed by a local or regional office or if the Global office will continue the investigation. It will also be determined if external service providers, such as lawyers or auditors need to be involved. Evidence Action’s board members, employees, contractors, and interns are required to cooperate in good faith in any investigation resulting from a report. Once the investigation is completed, the Chief People Officer or the appointee will recommend an appropriate course of action, including any potential disciplinary action. ---\nActing in Good Faith\n\nIt is contrary to the values of Evidence Action for anyone to retaliate against any board member, employee, intern, or contractor who in good faith reports a serious concern or potential violation. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to disciplinary action.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BZY4BQeGOuFWpEzWOqrsAYUWz3nIm5oZ0woxzL45+6M="},"e48dade1-956c-41f2-9b7e-e18650fdd817":{"id_":"e48dade1-956c-41f2-9b7e-e18650fdd817","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf_1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"hash":"FfrjktVfPvyzaQ+K7pqLUFTiuB0i8K7FdPFc+AoGKaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1921a672-d906-41ec-98d1-cc735b52f3b1","metadata":{"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Luis Maradiaga\\PycharmProjects\\EAChatBot-v2\\eachatbot-v2\\data\\Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf","file_name":"Whistleblower Policy_11.1.2020.pdf"},"hash":"BZY4BQeGOuFWpEzWOqrsAYUWz3nIm5oZ0woxzL45+6M="}},"text":"In reporting any concern or potential violation, reporting misconduct or cooperating in any investigation, an employee must act in good faith.
